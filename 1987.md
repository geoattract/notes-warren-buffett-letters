# Warren Buffett's 1987 Shareholder Letter: 7 Key Insights

---

## **Point 1: Extraordinary Business Value Premium Through Superior Management**

**Key Message:** Berkshire's seven core operating units generate exceptional returns on equity (57% after-tax) that far exceed even the best Fortune 500 companies, driven entirely by outstanding management execution.

**Details:** These seven businesses—Buffalo News, Fechheimer, Kirby, Nebraska Furniture Mart, Scott Fetzer Manufacturing Group, See's Candies, and World Book—produced $100 million in after-tax earnings on just $175 million of equity capital in 1987. This 57% return on equity vastly exceeds the Fortune 500 average: only six of 1,000 companies averaged over 30% ROE in the preceding decade, with Commerce Clearing House leading at 40.2%. Buffett explicitly credits the "Sainted Seven" managers—the Blumkins, Heldmans, Chuck Huggins, Stan Lipsey, and Ralph Schey—whose talent, energy, and character produce "exceptional financial results."

**Why It Matters:** This demonstrates that superior management and strong business models can generate returns that are simply unavailable in most industries. For investors, this highlights the critical importance of backing exceptional managers running businesses with durable competitive advantages rather than chasing growth in mediocre businesses.

## **Point 2: Business Value Vastly Exceeds Book Value When Assets Are Well-Deployed**

**Key Message:** Berkshire's premium of business value over book value has widened significantly, proving that accounting values can be misleading—true value lies in underlying earning power.

**Details:** While book value grew from $19.46 to $2,477.47 per share over 23 years (23.1% compounded annually), the letter emphasizes that "what counts is the rate of gain in per-share business value, not book value." Berkshire's seven major operating units are carried on the balance sheet at approximately $222 million above their historical asset values, yet their true economic value is far higher. Buffett contrasts this with companies like LTV and Baldwin-United, which showed substantial book values ($652 million and $397 million respectively) immediately before bankruptcy, while Belridge Oil sold for $3.6 billion despite only $177 million in book value.

**Why It Matters:** This insight is crucial for investors evaluating companies. Book value can be completely disconnected from economic reality. The key question is whether capital is generating high returns, not what historical cost accounting says an asset is worth.

## **Point 3: Stability and Incremental Improvement Beat Dramatic Change**

**Key Message:** The best long-term business returns come from companies doing essentially the same things they did 5-10 years ago, but doing them better—not from companies undergoing revolutionary transformation.

**Details:** Buffett notes that "severe change and exceptional returns usually don't mix" and that most investors mistakenly award the highest price-earnings multiples to exotic businesses promising feverish change. However, Fortune's study of 25 business superstars (companies with 10-year ROE over 20% and never a year under 15%) revealed that 24 of 25 outperformed the S&P 500 despite being in "rather mundane" businesses. Most sold "non-sexy products or services in much the same manner as they did ten years ago." Berkshire's managers succeed by "protecting their franchises, controlling costs, searching for new products that build on existing strengths, and not getting diverted."

**Why It Matters:** This challenges conventional wisdom that growth and innovation drive returns. It suggests that companies with moats (like Nebraska Furniture Mart's customer loyalty or See's brand strength) can compound wealth reliably by incremental excellence rather than disruption.

## **Point 4: Capital Allocation Skills Are Rare and Undervalued in CEO Evaluation**

**Key Message:** Most CEOs lack capital allocation expertise despite its critical importance—they're typically promoted for excellence in marketing, engineering, or operations, not financial stewardship.

**Details:** Buffett explains that after 10 years as CEO, someone whose company retains earnings equal to 10% of net worth will have been responsible for deploying over 60% of all capital in the business. Yet most CEOs "may have never tackled" capital allocation and it "is not easily mastered." The analogy is apt: "It's as if the final step for a highly-talented musician was not to perform at Carnegie Hall but, instead, to be named Chairman of the Federal Reserve." When CEOs try to compensate by hiring consultants or investment bankers, Buffett and Munger have "frequently observed" it "is more likely to accentuate the capital-allocation problem than to solve it."

**Why It Matters:** This is a signal to investors to pay close attention to how management deploys capital—acquisitions, buybacks, dividends, organic investment. Poor capital allocation can destroy shareholder value even if operations are sound.

## **Point 5: Insurance Economics Are Deteriorating Due to Legal Inflation and Capacity Expansion**

**Key Message:** The insurance industry is entering a downturn after boom years (1985-87) because competitors will expand capacity when prices are high, following the historical pattern of ignoring lessons from the past.

**Details:** Berkshire's insurance combined ratio table shows the industry's fundamental problem: "social and judicial inflation" (skyrocketing courtroom costs and expanding insurance coverage via judicial reinterpretation) drive losses when premium growth slows. The industry needs 10% annual revenue growth "just to hold its own" despite inflation running much lower. After strong growth in 1985-87, volume gains decelerated from 12.9% (Q1 1987) to 5.6% (Q4 1987). Buffett predicts "the party is over" in 1988, citing Disraeli: "What we learn from history is that we do not learn from history." Managers expand capacity during shortages, plugging "the hole through which money is showering upon them."

**Why It Matters:** This warns investors that even profitable industries can deteriorate when competition floods capacity. It demonstrates Buffett's realistic view of industry cycles and his willingness to reduce volume rather than chase market share during unprofitable periods.

## **Point 6: Financial Strength Is a Competitive Moat Only During Market Stress**

**Key Message:** Berkshire differentiates itself in insurance through superior financial strength and absolute price discipline—two advantages that matter most when competitors fail or capital becomes scarce.

**Details:** Buffett acknowledges that superior financial strength means little in personal insurance (claims get paid even if insurers fail) or when corporate buyers are complacent. However, "periodically, buyers remember Ben Franklin's observation that it is hard for an empty sack to stand upright" and seek insurers they can trust when complex claims arise 5-10 years later during depressed financial markets. At such times, "Berkshire will lead the pack." Additionally, Berkshire maintains "total indifference to volume"—it will write five times as much business or one-fifth as much, depending on pricing. This flexibility is rare: most insurers can't sustain reduced volumes without intolerable costs, but Berkshire's people-based capacity allows "quarter-speed" operations with no terminal decline in long-term prosperity.

**Why It Matters:** This reveals how competitive advantages can be structural rather than temporary. Buffett's willingness to sacrifice short-term earnings for principled pricing creates a reservoir of capacity that becomes invaluable during crises.

## **Point 7: Market Volatility and "Portfolio Insurance" Create Opportunities for Patient Investors**

**Key Message:** The October 1987 crash exposed how institutional money managers' algorithmic selling (portfolio insurance) creates irrational market behavior that benefits disciplined long-term investors.

**Details:** Buffett criticizes "portfolio insurance"—a strategy where predetermined price declines automatically trigger massive sales. According to the Brady Report, $60-90 billion in equities were "poised on this hair trigger" in October 1987. He ridicules the logic: "After buying a farm, would a rational owner order his real estate agent to start selling off pieces whenever a neighboring property sold at a lower price?" Yet pension funds and universities follow exactly this Alice-in-Wonderland approach. Paradoxically, Buffett argues this volatility "is ideal for any investor—small or large—so long as he sticks to his investment knitting." Volatility from "money managers who speculate irrationally with huge sums will offer the true investor more chances to make intelligent investment moves."

**Why It Matters:** This explains how market dislocations benefit those with dry powder and conviction. Berkshire held few major stock positions at yearend 1987, but was ready to act—and would have, had stocks remained depressed.

## **Point 8: Taxing Dividends on Controlled Companies Disadvantages Corporate Ownership**

**Key Message:** Tax code changes (Tax Reform Act of 1986 and 1987 amendments) have created a structural disadvantage for corporate holders of partial stock positions versus individual owners or 80%+ controlling stakes.

**Details:** The 1986 and 1987 tax bills reduced intercorporate dividends-received credits from 80% to 70%, with exemptions only for 20%+ ownership stakes. Buffett notes that Berkshire's permanent holdings (Capital Cities/ABC, GEICO, Washington Post) have market value over $2 billion but produced only $11 million in reported after-tax earnings for Berkshire in 1987, because accounting rules allow Berkshire to record only dividends received (nominal) rather than its share of actual earnings ($100+ million). This tax burden is now so significant that "a given business result can deliver Berkshire financial results as much as 50% better if they come from an 80%-or-greater holding rather than from a lesser holding." Buffett explicitly states: "We have no way of offsetting this increased level of taxation."

**Why It Matters:** This highlights how tax policy can reshape investment returns and explains Berkshire's preference for 100% control when possible, and its massive positions in permanent holdings where quality justifies acceptance of tax inefficiency.

## **Executive Summary**

Warren Buffett's 1987 letter showcases a company at peak operational excellence, with seven outstanding businesses generating extraordinary returns (57% on equity) through superior management rather than leverage or financial engineering. However, the letter reveals growing headwinds: insurance industry capacity expansion is destroying economics just as tax code changes penalize corporate stock ownership, and stock market volatility (triggered by institutional "portfolio insurance" algorithms) is creating opportunities but limited availability of attractive securities.

The central themes are constancy and clarity. Berkshire's operating philosophy—do ordinary things exceptionally well, protect franchises, control costs, maintain financial strength for opportunities—remains unchanged despite prosperity. Buffett explicitly rejects the idea that dramatic change drives returns; instead, he documents how 25 Fortune 500 superstars achieved 20%+ ROE through stable, focused execution. His insurance section is particularly revealing: Berkshire can't control commodity insurance economics, but it can maintain price discipline and financial strength—advantages that matter intensely during downturns while adding little during boom times.

The letter also demonstrates Buffett's realistic view of competitive advantage. Financial strength in insurance is valuable only when it's scarce (during crises); business value premium over book value depends on management quality, not accounting values; and tax changes can structurally alter investment returns regardless of operational performance. For investors, the core lesson is that sustainable returns come from identified moats, exceptional management, and patient capital deployed into dislocations—not from following the crowd or chasing growth in mediocre businesses. As Buffett notes via Mr. Market allegory: "If you've been in the game 30 minutes and you don't know who the patsy is, you're the patsy."
