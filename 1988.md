# Berkshire Hathaway 1988 Shareholder Letter: 8 Key Insights

## **Insight 1: The Compounding Burden of Capital—The Math Gets Harder**

**Key Message:** As Berkshire's capital base grows, maintaining the same percentage returns requires exponentially larger absolute profits, making future performance increasingly difficult.

**Details:** Four years ago (1984), Buffett noted that achieving a 15% annual return over the following decade required $3.9 billion in profits. Now (1988), that same 15% target demands $10.3 billion in profits over the next decade—a 164% increase in required earnings despite the company growing only 24 years instead of 20. Buffett describes this as "a very big number" that he and Charlie Munger view with significant concern. The mathematical reality: while a smaller company earning 15% can double in size, a larger company earning 15% must grow far more in absolute terms, making each incremental basis point of return exponentially harder to achieve.

**Why It Matters:** This reveals a rarely-discussed constraint in investing: past success creates mathematical drag on future returns. No matter how exceptional your management, a $10 billion capital base cannot grow as fast as a $1 billion base at the same percentage return. This is not a criticism of Berkshire's management—it's an immutable law of compound mathematics that should temper expectations for any maturing investment vehicle.

## **Insight 2: The "Sainted Seven"—Building Exceptional Franchises Within the Conglomerate**

**Key Message:** Berkshire's operating businesses (Buffalo News, Fechheimer, Kirby, Nebraska Furniture Mart, Scott Fetzer Manufacturing, See's, and World Book) generated extraordinary returns on capital, earning approximately 67% on average equity capital with no financial leverage.

**Details:** The letter explicitly identifies seven operating businesses that performed exceptionally in 1988. Examining the historical-cost financial statements reveals these "Saints came marching in" with remarkable 67% returns on average equity capital—extraordinary by any measure. These businesses share common characteristics: exceptional business franchises (moats), exceptional management, and minimal financial leverage. Buffett notes that "without this help Berkshire would not have a chance of achieving our 15% goal." The operating managers deliver consistently; the question mark is whether Buffett and Munger can effectively deploy the capital these businesses generate.

**Why It Matters:** This demonstrates Berkshire's strategic advantage: owning a portfolio of exceptional businesses within a single holding company structure. Rather than relying solely on capital allocation and stock picking (where the market has become less attractive), Berkshire has built internal franchises that generate high-return capital to redeploy. This creates a self-reinforcing cycle where exceptional operating businesses fund the search for new acquisitions.

## **Insight 3: Borsheim's Acquisition—The Trust-Based Deal**

**Key Message:** Berkshire's $80% acquisition of Borsheim's jewelry store exemplifies its dealmaking philosophy: family-owned business, exceptional management, minimal due diligence, and acquisition based purely on trust.

**Details:** Buffett notes that in 1983 he made an error by not asking Mrs. B (Rose Blumkin) "Are there any more at home like you?" He corrected this mistake by acquiring an 80% stake in Borsheim's, owned by the Friedman family—relatives of Mrs. B. Remarkably, the acquisition required no audited financial statements, inventory verification, receivables audit, or operational analysis. "Ike simply told us what was so—and on that basis we drew up a one-page contract and wrote a large check." The Friedman family operates under the same philosophy as the Blumkins: "Sell cheap and tell the truth." Key operational metrics include huge single-store inventories, daily management attention, rapid turnover, shrewd buying, and incredibly low expenses—enabling everyday prices "that no one in the country comes close to matching."

**Why It Matters:** This demonstrates that exceptional acquisition opportunities often involve human judgment and trust rather than analytical rigor. Buffett's willingness to acquire Borsheim's on a one-page contract reflects his understanding that character, integrity, and exceptional management are better predictors of business success than exhaustive due diligence. This approach only works when you've built decades of reputation and can identify genuinely exceptional people.

## **Insight 4: The Insurance Industry Cycle—A Commodity Trapped in Perpetual Boom-and-Bust**

**Key Message:** Property-casualty insurance operates in predictable but severe cycles where premiums eventually fail to keep pace with loss growth, guaranteeing future underwriting losses regardless of current profitability.

**Details:** Buffett provides historical data showing the insurance industry's inexorable cycle: premiums grew 22.2% in 1986 and 9.4% in 1987, but slowed to only 3.9% in 1988. Meanwhile, loss growth continues at roughly 10% annually (driven by social and judicial inflation), meaning the industry needs 10% premium growth just to maintain underwriting profitability. The combined ratio deteriorated from 104.6 in 1987 to 105.4 in 1988, signaling the beginning of underwriting losses that "is almost certain to continue—and probably will accelerate—for at least two more years." Buffett notes that despite current industry prosperity, "the property-casualty insurance industry is not only subnormally profitable, it is subnormally popular." This contrasts sharply with the breakfast cereal industry (which earns double the return on capital yet faces zero customer complaints about pricing).

**Why It Matters:** This illustrates the difference between temporary industry conditions and sustainable business economics. Even Berkshire's exceptional insurance operation cannot escape the underlying commodity dynamics. The letter sets realistic expectations: regardless of current performance, the industry will eventually face underwriting losses—it's not a question of if, but when and how severe. This honesty about cyclical headwinds is rarer than most companies' rosy projections.

## **Insight 5: Regulatory Risk and Political Vulnerability—Proposition 103's Threat to GEICO**

**Key Message:** Even exceptional businesses face existential regulatory risk when political sentiment turns against their industry, as evidenced by California's Proposition 103.

**Details:** California voters passed Proposition 103 in 1988, which threatens to push auto insurance prices "down sharply, even though costs have been soaring." Though the initiative's implementation was suspended pending court review, Buffett warns that "even if the initiative is overturned, insurers are likely to find it tough to operate profitably in California." This poses significant risk to GEICO, which derives about 10% of its premium volume from California. More broadly, Buffett warns that "if voters insist that auto insurance be priced below cost, it eventually must be sold by government." While most insurers would survive this outcome (lacking economic goodwill to lose), GEICO faces "a huge amount of economic goodwill at risk" due to its low-cost competitive advantage.

**Why It Matters:** This reveals that even the most exceptional businesses face regulatory and political risks beyond management control. GEICO's structural cost advantage—its primary moat—could be negated by government price controls that force unprofitable operations. Buffett's willingness to acknowledge this risk (rather than dismissing it) demonstrates intellectual honesty about the limits of operational excellence when politics enter the picture.

## **Insight 6: Arbitrage as a 63-Year Track Record Against Efficient Market Theory**

**Key Message:** Berkshire's six-decade arbitrage track record (averaging 20% annual returns) provides compelling empirical evidence that markets are not always efficient, contradicting academic dogma.

**Details:** Buffett documents that Graham-Newman Corp. (1926-1956) and his subsequent Berkshire partnership achieved unleveraged arbitrage returns averaging 20% annually over 63 years—while the general market delivered just under 10%. This produced a striking differential: $1,000 invested at 10% would have grown to $405,000, while 20% would have produced $97 million. Despite this statistically-significant evidence, academic proponents of Efficient Market Theory (EMT) have never recanted their theories or acknowledged the disconfirming evidence. Buffett notes that EMT continues to be taught at major business schools despite decades of contradictory evidence.

**Why It Matters:** This section illustrates how markets can be rational on average while containing exploitable inefficiencies for disciplined investors. The irony is that EMT's widespread teaching has been "an extraordinary service to us and other followers of Graham" because it discourages competitors. Buffett notes: "In any sort of contest—financial, mental, or physical—it's an enormous advantage to have opponents who have been taught that it's useless to even try." This is a rare moment where Buffett explicitly acknowledges how academic dogma has been competitive advantage for value investors.

## **Insight 7: Accounting Doesn't Equal Economics—The Four-Sector Reporting Innovation**

**Key Message:** GAAP consolidated statements can obscure economic reality, so Berkshire is adopting supplementary four-sector reporting to help shareholders understand true business economics.

**Details:** Forced by new GAAP rules requiring full consolidation of all subsidiaries, Berkshire has introduced supplementary financial statements organized into four economic sectors: (1) finance-type operations (Mutual Savings and Scott Fetzer Financial); (2) insurance operations with major investment positions itemized; (3) manufacturing, publishing, and retailing businesses; and (4) all-other including non-operating assets. Buffett explains that consolidated GAAP figures are less useful because they lump together economically diverse businesses, making it impossible for investors to answer three critical questions: (1) How much is this company worth? (2) Can it meet future obligations? (3) How good a job are managers doing? Buffett notes that "the only reason we ever prepare consolidated figures at Berkshire is to meet outside requirements. On the other hand, Charlie and I constantly study our segment data."

**Why It Matters:** This demonstrates that excellent corporate communication requires going beyond GAAP minimums. By providing supplementary segment data organized by economic logic (rather than corporate structure), Berkshire makes itself far more transparent and analyzable. This also implicitly criticizes management teams that hide behind GAAP minimums, noting that "many managements view GAAP not as a standard to be met, but as an obstacle to overcome." Buffett's willingness to provide extra disclosure suggests that honest companies have nothing to hide from supplementary analysis.

## **Insight 8: The NYSE Listing and "Intrinsic Value" Philosophy—Long-Term Owners Only**

**Key Message:** Berkshire's 1988 NYSE listing reflects a deliberate strategy to attract long-term owners focused on intrinsic business value, not short-term traders.

**Details:** While most companies list on exchanges to maximize trading volume and stock price appreciation, Berkshire explicitly states opposite goals: "We do not want to maximize the price at which Berkshire shares trade. We wish instead for them to trade in a narrow range centered at intrinsic business value." Buffett explains that both overvaluation and undervaluation produce poor shareholder results because they decouple individual returns from business results. Additionally, Berkshire wants "very little trading activity"—the company would be "disappointed if those partners, and their replacements, frequently wanted to leave." Instead, Berkshire seeks shareholders who "at the time of purchase, have no timetable or price target for sale but plan instead to stay with us indefinitely." The company uses pricing, policies, and communications to "attract long-term owners who...understand our operations, share our time horizons, and measure us as we measure ourselves."

**Why It Matters:** This reveals Buffett's philosophical approach to public ownership: treating shareholders as permanent partners rather than trading vehicles. By explicitly discouraging short-term traders and welcoming only patient capital, Berkshire creates an alignment between shareholder interests and management incentives. This is the opposite of modern corporate practice, where management celebrates high trading volumes and stock appreciation (even when unwarranted). Buffett's approach suggests that the best shareholder returns flow from patient capital and management that focuses on business value rather than stock price.

## Executive Summary

Berkshire Hathaway's 1988 letter reveals an organization confronting both structural constraints and strategic opportunities. The fundamental constraint is mathematical: as capital base grows from billions to tens of billions, maintaining the same percentage returns requires finding increasingly larger acquisition opportunities and deploying capital through exceptional operating businesses. This is not a failure of management—it reflects an immutable truth about compound mathematics that should moderate expectations for any maturing investment vehicle.

Yet within this constraint, Berkshire has built a powerful advantage through the "Sainted Seven" operating businesses, which generate 67% returns on capital and provide a self-reinforcing engine for growth. The Borsheim's acquisition exemplifies Berkshire's dealmaking philosophy: acquiring family-owned businesses run by exceptional people, based on character and trust rather than exhaustive due diligence. This approach only works because Buffett has spent decades building reputation and judgment about exceptional human beings.

The insurance section reveals how Berkshire manages commoditized businesses within structural cycles. Despite excellent 1988 underwriting results, Buffett warns that industry losses will "almost certainly continue—and probably will accelerate—for at least two more years." This honesty about inevitable cycles (rather than pretending to control the uncontrollable) demonstrates intellectual humility. Similarly, the Proposition 103 discussion acknowledges that even exceptional businesses face regulatory and political risks beyond management control.

The arbitrage section provides empirical evidence demolishing Efficient Market Theory—showing 63 years of 20% annual returns while the market delivered 10%. Buffett notes with dry humor that academic insistence on EMT has been "an extraordinary service to us" by discouraging competitors from even trying. This illustrates how misguided theory (combined with widespread teaching) creates persistent market inefficiencies for disciplined investors.

Finally, the NYSE listing and accounting innovation sections demonstrate Buffett's commitment to transparency and long-term ownership. By supplementing GAAP statements with four-sector economic reporting, and by explicitly discouraging short-term traders while welcoming patient capital, Berkshire aligns its shareholder base with its long-term philosophy. This is revolutionary in modern corporate practice, where management typically chases stock price appreciation and trading volume.

For investors, the key lessons are: (1) acknowledge the mathematical constraints of scale on future returns; (2) build internal franchises that generate high-return capital to redeploy; (3) identify and partner with exceptional people, and then stay out of their way; (4) maintain realistic expectations about cyclical industries; (5) recognize that even exceptional businesses face political and regulatory risks; and (6) structure your company to attract patient capital focused on business value rather than stock price appreciation. These principles explain how Berkshire has sustained extraordinary returns while being honest about future constraints.
