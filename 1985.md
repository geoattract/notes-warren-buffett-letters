# Warren Buffett's 1985 Berkshire Hathaway Shareholder Letter: 9 Key Insights

---

## **Point 1: Halley's Comet Returns—The 48.2% Gain Is Unrepeatable, Historical 23.2% Returns Are Over**

**Key Message:** While 1985's exceptional 48.2% gain coincided with Halley's Comet's return (neither will be seen again in Buffett's lifetime), this outsized return masks a fundamental shift: size constraints and market valuations make historical 23.2% compounded returns mathematically impossible to sustain.

**Details:** Buffett opens with characteristic humor: "Our gain in net worth during the year was $613.6 million, or 48.2%. It is fitting that the visit of Halley's Comet coincided with this percentage gain: neither will be seen again in my lifetime."

Yet he immediately qualifies this: "Two factors make anything approaching this rate of gain unachievable in the future. One factor probably transitory - is a stock market that offers very little opportunity compared to the markets that prevailed throughout much of the 1964-1984 period."

The second factor is far more telling: "The second negative factor, far more telling, is our size. Our equity capital is more than twenty times what it was only ten years ago. And an iron law of business is that growth eventually dampens exceptional economics."

The mathematics become stark: "To earn even 15% annually over the next decade (assuming we continue to follow our present dividend policy, about which more will be said later in this letter) we would need profits aggregating about $3.9 billion. The comparable figure for the ten years now ahead is $5.7 billion, a 48% increase...leaving aside oil companies, only about 15 U.S. businesses have managed to earn over $5.7 billion during the past ten years."

**Why It Matters:** This represents extraordinary intellectual honesty. Rather than projecting continued exceptional returns, Buffett acknowledges that size creates mathematical constraints on growth rates. This principle applies to all successful businesses—the larger the capital base, the more difficult it becomes to achieve high percentage returns. This insight has profound implications for how shareholders should evaluate Berkshire's future prospects.

## **Point 2: Berkshire Shares Now Trade at Premium to Intrinsic Value—New Purchasers Face Headwind**

**Key Message:** Historically, Berkshire shares traded modestly below intrinsic business value, ensuring that purchasers' investment experience would match business performance. This discount has now disappeared, and occasional premiums have prevailed—creating unfavorable economics for new investors.

**Details:** Buffett identifies a critical shift in valuation: "We need to mention one further item in the investment equation that could affect recent purchasers of our stock. Historically, Berkshire shares have sold modestly below intrinsic business value. With the price there, purchasers could be certain (as long as they did not experience a widening of this discount) that their personal investment experience would at least equal the financial experience of the business."

But market dynamics have changed: "Recently the discount has disappeared, and occasionally a modest premium has prevailed. The elimination of the discount means that Berkshire's market value increased even faster than business value (which, itself, grew at a pleasing pace). That was good news for any owner holding while that move took place, but it is bad news for the new or prospective owner."

He explains the mathematics: "If the financial experience of new owners of Berkshire is merely to match the future financial experience of the company, any premium of market value over intrinsic business value that they pay must be maintained."

Yet he credits shareholders for rational pricing behavior: "Over the long term there has been a more consistent relationship between Berkshire's market value and business value than has existed for any other publicly-traded equity with which I am familiar. This is a tribute to you. Because you have been rational, interested, and investment-oriented, the market price for Berkshire stock has almost always been sensible."

He attributes this to Berkshire's unusual shareholder base: "This unusual result has been achieved by a shareholder group with unusual demographics: virtually all of our shareholders are individuals, not institutions. No other public company our size can claim the same."

**Why It Matters:** This honest warning to new purchasers demonstrates Buffett's commitment to transparency about valuation risks. He explicitly warns that buying at premiums to intrinsic value creates unfavorable risk-reward dynamics, even for a high-quality business. This contrasts with most corporate managements, which typically promote their own stocks without qualification.

## **Point 3: Shutdown of Textile Business—A Masterclass in Recognizing When to Exit**

**Key Message:** Despite 21 years of management excellence under Ken Chace and Garry Morrison, Berkshire's textile business could never generate returns commensurate with capital employed, demonstrating that superior management cannot overcome structural industry economics.

**Details:** Buffett provides a comprehensive post-mortem of the textile business. When Berkshire acquired it in 1964, accounting net worth was $22 million, but intrinsic value was considerably less because "the textile assets were unable to earn returns commensurate with their accounting value. Indeed, during the previous nine years...aggregate sales of $530 million had produced an aggregate loss of $10 million."

The managers were exceptional: "We felt, however, that the business would be run much better by a long-time employee whom we immediately selected to be president, Ken Chace. In this respect we were 100% correct: Ken and his recent successor, Garry Morrison, have been excellent managers, every bit the equal of managers at our more profitable businesses."

Yet even excellent management couldn't save structurally weak economics: "Although much improved by Ken's management, the textile business never became a good earner, not even in cyclical upturns."

Buffett admits his own error in persisting: "I won't close down businesses of sub-normal profitability merely to add a fraction of a point to our corporate rate of return. However, I also feel it inappropriate for even an exceptionally profitable company to fund an operation once it appears to have unending losses in prospect...I should be faulted for not quitting sooner. A recent Business Week article stated that 250 textile mills have closed since 1980. Their owners were not privy to any information that was unknown to me; they simply processed it more objectively."

He contrasts Berkshire's decision with Burlington Industries' fate. Burlington invested $3 billion in capital improvements (over $200 per share on its 1964 stock price) attempting to compete. Yet "Burlington has lost sales volume in real dollars and has far lower returns on sales and equity now than 20 years ago...the stock now sells at 34 -- on an adjusted basis, just a little over its $60 price in 1964. Meanwhile, the CPI has more than tripled."

Buffett's conclusion is unequivocal: "My conclusion from my own experiences and from much observation of other businesses is that a good managerial record (measured by economic returns) is far more a function of what business boat you get into than it is of how effectively you row (though intelligence and effort help considerably, of course, in any business, good or bad)...When a management with a reputation for brilliance tackles a business with a reputation for poor fundamental economics, it is the reputation of the business that remains intact."

The auction of textile machinery provided a final humbling lesson: Equipment that had cost $13 million (including $2 million spent in 1980-84) and had a book value of $866,000 sold for only $163,122 gross proceeds—actually a net loss after disposal costs. "Relatively modern looms that we bought for $5,000 apiece in 1981 found no takers at $50. We finally sold them for scrap at $26 each, a sum less than removal costs."

Yet even scrap machinery value exceeded the discounted value of some businesses: "Ponder this: the economic goodwill attributable to two paper routes in Buffalo - or a single See's candy store - considerably exceeds the proceeds we received from this massive collection of tangible assets that not too many years ago, under different competitive conditions, was able to employ over 1,000 people."

**Why It Matters:** This extended examination of textile failure reveals that business economics matter far more than management quality. It also demonstrates Buffett's willingness to admit prolonged errors and acknowledge that tangible asset value (book value) can massively overstate intrinsic value in deteriorating industries—a critical insight often missed by value investors anchored on replacement cost or book value metrics.

## **Point 4: Nebraska Furniture Mart, See's Candies, and Buffalo News Generate $72 Million Pre-Tax Earnings on Modest Incremental Capital**

**Key Message:** These three businesses exemplify Berkshire's operational excellence: earnings grew from $8 million to $72 million over 15 years while requiring only $40 million in additional incremental capital—demonstrating the power of economic goodwill in inflationary environments.

**Details:** Buffett explains why this seemingly terrific earnings growth masks an even more important achievement: "While an increase in earnings from $8 million to $72 million sounds terrific - and usually is - you should not automatically assume that to be the case. You must first make sure that earnings were not severely depressed in the base year. If they were instead substantial in relation to capital employed, an even more important point must be examined: how much additional capital was required to produce the additional earnings?"

The answer reveals the exceptional nature of these businesses: "In both respects, our group of three scores well. First, earnings 15 years ago were excellent compared to capital then employed in the businesses. Second, although annual earnings are now $64 million greater, the businesses require only about $40 million more in invested capital to operate than was the case then."

He contrasts this with typical American business: "Corporate America, however, has had a different experience: in order to increase earnings significantly, most companies have needed to increase capital significantly also. The average American business has required about $5 of additional capital to generate an additional $1 of annual pre-tax earnings. That business, therefore, would have required over $300 million in additional capital from its owners in order to achieve an earnings performance equal to our group of three."

**Why It Matters:** This comparison reveals why businesses with strong competitive moats and pricing power (See's candy, Buffalo News in dominant position, Nebraska Furniture Mart's efficiency) are so valuable—they generate earnings growth with minimal incremental capital investment, allowing retained earnings to be deployed elsewhere.

## **Point 5: Fixed-Price Stock Options Reward Retention of Earnings Rather Than Operating Excellence—Berkshire Uses Performance-Based Incentives Instead**

**Key Message:** Traditional ten-year fixed-price options often reward managers simply for retaining earnings that compound automatically, not for superior operating performance. Berkshire instead ties incentive compensation to specific business unit performance regardless of stock price.

**Details:** Buffett delivers a comprehensive critique of standard equity compensation practices through a detailed thought experiment. He imagines a savings account earning 8% annually where the trustee controls the dividend payout ratio and receives fixed-price options based on the account's first-year value.

The results? With a 25% payout ratio (75% retained), the account grows to $179,084 in ten years, annual earnings increase 70%, and the trustee gains substantially from his option simply because he retained the earnings—not because he generated superior returns.

His key insight: "Many stock options in the corporate world have worked in exactly that fashion: they have gained in value simply because management retained earnings, not because it did well with the capital in its hands."

He notes the perverse double standard: "Nowhere in the business world are ten-year fixed-price options on all or a portion of a business granted to outsiders. Ten months, in fact, would be regarded as extreme." Yet managers routinely grant themselves such options while ignoring that retained earnings automatically build value.

Most damningly: "A managerial Rip Van Winkle, ready to doze for ten years, could not wish for a better 'incentive' system."

Buffett praises rare exceptions but then outlines Berkshire's alternative approach: "At Berkshire, however, we use an incentive compensation system that rewards key managers for meeting targets in their own bailiwicks. If See's does well, that does not produce incentive compensation at the News - nor vice versa. Neither do we look at the price of Berkshire stock when we write bonus checks."

The results can be substantial: "The rewards that go with this system can be large. At our various business units, top managers sometimes receive incentive bonuses of five times their base salary, or more, and it would appear possible that one manager's bonus could top $2 million in 1986."

Notably, managers can buy Berkshire stock in the market with their bonuses, aligning their interests with shareholders: "By accepting both the risks and the carrying costs that go with outright purchases, these managers truly walk in the shoes of owners."

**Why It Matters:** This analysis explains why compensation structure profoundly affects management incentives and why Berkshire's performance-based, business-unit-focused approach better aligns managers with shareholder interests than typical stock option plans. This principle has influenced compensation practices across corporate America.

## **Point 6: Scott & Fetzer Acquisition Demonstrates "Haphazard" Yet Highly Disciplined Approach to M&A**

**Key Message:** Berkshire acquired Scott & Fetzer for $320 million (plus $90 million existing debt) based on a simple October letter from Buffett to CEO Ralph Schey, demonstrating that disciplined opportunism beats elaborate strategic planning.

**Details:** Buffett's approach is refreshingly informal. He had followed Scott & Fetzer's corporate odyssey through newspapers, noting that an ESOP-based sale had fallen through. On October 10, he simply wrote to Ralph Schey (whom he did not know) expressing interest. They met for dinner October 22 and signed the acquisition contract the following week.

Yet this "haphazard" approach masked rigorous disciplinary criteria: Scott & Fetzer had "sales of about $700 million derived from 17 businesses, many leaders in their fields. Return on invested capital is good to excellent for most of these businesses."

Most notably, World Book—accounting for 40% of sales and more of income—is the clear industry leader: "It also is by far the leader in its industry, selling more than twice as many encyclopedia sets annually as its nearest competitor. In fact, it sells more sets in the U.S. than its four biggest competitors combined."

Buffett emphasizes World Book's value: "It's regularly rated the most useful encyclopedia by teachers, librarians and consumer buying guides. Yet it sells for less than any of its major competitors."

The CEO was equally important: "An equal attraction at Scott Fetzer is Ralph Schey, its CEO for nine years. When Ralph took charge, the company had 31 businesses...He disposed of many that did not fit or had limited profit potential...Ralph's operating and capital-allocation record is superb."

Buffett acknowledges his own past mistake: When Cap Cities stock traded at $43 per share in 1978-80, he sold Berkshire's holdings. Now he's buying at $172.50. He admits: "A little more time, please" regarding reconciling this apparent contradiction.

**Why It Matters:** The Scott & Fetzer acquisition demonstrates that superior capital allocation comes not from elaborate strategic planning but from disciplined criteria combined with opportunism. When businesses meeting Berkshire's standards appear available, Buffett can act decisively.

## **Point 7: Capital Cities/ABC Purchase Demonstrates Willingness to Pay Fair Prices for Exceptional Management**

**Key Message:** Berkshire paid full price ($172.50 per share, or $517.5 million total) for 3 million Capital Cities shares to finance ABC's $3.5 billion acquisition, reflecting confidence in Tom Murphy and Dan Burke's management rather than expecting a bargain purchase.

**Details:** Buffett's admiration for Capital Cities management is unqualified: "I've been on record for many years about the management of Cap Cities: I think it is the best of any publicly-owned company in the country. And Tom Murphy and Dan Burke are not only great managers, they are precisely the sort of fellows that you would want your daughter to marry."

The unusual governance structure reveals Buffett's confidence: "As evidence of our confidence, we have executed an unusual agreement: for an extended period Tom, as CEO (or Dan, should he be CEO) votes our stock. This arrangement was initiated by Charlie and me, not by Tom."

Buffett also restricted sale of the shares: "The object of these restrictions is to make sure that our block does not get sold to anyone who is a large holder (or intends to become a large holder) without the approval of management."

He explains the economic logic: "With them in place, the first-class managers with whom we have aligned ourselves can focus their efforts entirely upon running the businesses and maximizing long-term values for owners. Certainly this is much better than having those managers distracted by 'revolving-door capitalists' hoping to put the company 'in play'."

Regarding the premium price: "Our Cap Cities purchase was made at a full price, reflecting the very considerable enthusiasm for both media stocks and media properties that has developed in recent years...it's no field for bargains. However, our Cap Cities investment allies us with an exceptional combination of properties and people - and we like the opportunity to participate in size."

**Why It Matters:** This purchase demonstrates that Buffett is willing to pay fair prices (not bargains) for exceptional management and business quality. It also shows his willingness to commit capital to large, quality opportunities that may take years to generate returns—the ABC integration "is a major undertaking whose economics are likely to be unexciting over the next few years. This bothers us not an iota; we can be very patient."

## **Point 8: Fireman's Fund Quota-Share Contract Creates $92.7 Million Float Without Insurance Risk**

**Key Message:** Berkshire entered a 7% participation agreement with Fireman's Fund (where Jack Byrne moved from GEICO) to participate in $3 billion of business, generating $92.7 million in unearned premium float while taking on proportionate underwriting risk—demonstrating creative capital deployment.

**Details:** The contract structure is elegant. Fireman's Fund remits premiums to Berkshire promptly, and Berkshire reimburses for expenses and losses. The $92.7 million in transferred unearned premium reserves becomes float that Berkshire can invest.

Buffett's involvement is carefully circumscribed: "As part of the deal, I'm available to FFIC for consultation about general investment strategy. I'm not involved, however, in specific investment decisions of FFIC, nor is Berkshire involved in any aspect of the company's underwriting activities."

The contract term is four years, after which "if there is no extension, we will thereafter have no participation in any ongoing business." However, "for a great many years in the future, we will be reimbursing FFIC for our 7% of the losses that occurred in the September 1, 1985 - August 31, 1989 period"—reflecting the long-tail nature of casualty insurance.

Berkshire's underwriting role expanded dramatically through this relationship and others: "To the Insurance Segment tables on page 41, we have added a new line, labeled Major Quota Share Contracts."

**Why It Matters:** This arrangement represents sophisticated capital deployment—gaining $92.7 million in float (which Berkshire can invest at returns it controls) while accepting proportionate insurance risk. This type of arrangement would become increasingly important to Berkshire's business model.

## **Point 9: Insurance Industry Will Cycle From Profit to Disaster as Capacity Additions Overwhelm Market**

**Key Message:** Despite 1985's premium growth reaching 20.9% (easing the combined ratio from 118% to estimated 118%), this improvement will prove temporary as insurers raise $3+ billion in capital, creating excess capacity that will inevitably destroy profitability.

**Details:** Buffett provides historical insurance data showing that 10% annual premium growth is necessary to maintain relatively stable combined ratios. When growth exceeded 10% (1976-1978), combined ratios improved. When growth fell below 10% (1980-1984), combined ratios deteriorated to 117.7%.

The 1985 exception is revealing: "The industry's 1985 results were highly unusual. The revenue gain was exceptional, and had insured losses grown at their normal rate of most recent years...a significant drop in the combined ratio would have occurred. But losses in 1985 didn't cooperate."

Most troublingly, losses accelerated despite moderating inflation: "Though inflation slowed considerably in these years, insured losses perversely accelerated, growing by 16% in 1984 and by an even more startling 17% in 1985. The year's growth in losses therefore exceeds the inflation rate by over 13 percentage points, a modern record."

The culprit is "social" or "judicial" inflation: "The insurer's ability to pay has assumed overwhelming importance with juries and judges in the assessment of both liability and damages. More and more, 'the deep pocket' is being sought and found, no matter what the policy wording, the facts, or the precedents."

Yet even this headwind cannot prevent cyclicality: "In 1985, about 15 insurers raised well over $3 billion, piling up capital so that they can write all the business possible at the better prices now available. The capital-raising trend has accelerated dramatically so far in 1986."

The inevitable result: "If capacity additions continue at this rate, it won't be long before serious price-cutting appears and next a fall in profitability. When the fall comes, it will be the fault of the capital-raisers of 1985 and 1986, not the price-cutters of 198X."

Yet this dynamic benefits Berkshire: "With the tightening of the market, that day arrived. Our premium volume more than tripled last year, following a long period of stagnation. Berkshire's financial strength (and our record of maintaining unusual strength through thick and thin) is now a major asset for us in securing good business."

**Why It Matters:** This analysis demonstrates that Berkshire's fortress balance sheet becomes most valuable precisely when competitors are weakened—allowing Berkshire to gain disproportionate market share while undercapitalized competitors exit. Buffett's ability to sit patiently through unprofitable cycles, then capitalize when conditions improve, has been central to Berkshire's insurance success.

## **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**

Warren Buffett's 1985 shareholder letter captures Berkshire at a transformational moment—transitioning from primarily a securities portfolio company toward an integrated conglomerate with major operating businesses. The 48.2% gain (Halley's Comet timing notwithstanding) obscures more important developments that establish Berkshire's future trajectory.

**First, Buffett's brutal honesty about unrepeatable returns represents a reckoning with mathematical constraints.** The 23.2% historical compound return is history. Earning even 15% on a vastly larger capital base requires $5.7 billion in profits—a figure fewer than 15 U.S. companies outside oil have achieved over a decade. Size inevitably dampens exceptional returns; this is not pessimism but mathematical reality.

**Second, the textile business closure is a masterclass in recognizing when superior management cannot overcome structural business economics.** Despite 21 years of excellent management, the business never generated returns commensurate with capital employed. Buffett's self-criticism for persisting too long provides crucial insight: when business fundamentals are unfavorable, managerial excellence provides diminishing returns. Choosing the right "business boat" matters far more than rowing skill.

**Third, the acquisition of Scott & Fetzer and significant Capital Cities investment reveal a strategic pivot toward larger acquisitions of quality businesses with exceptional management.** Rather than pursuing bargain purchases, Buffett increasingly buys full-price stakes in outstanding businesses run by outstanding people. This reflects market saturation (great businesses are no longer "totally unappreciated") and recognition that quality compounds.

**Fourth, Berkshire's insurance business transitions from cyclical loser to competitive advantage.** With fortress capital position and underwriting discipline, Berkshire gains market share precisely when undercapitalized competitors struggle. This transforms insurance from a drag on returns into a competitive moat—a pattern that would accelerate dramatically through subsequent decades.

**Fifth, Berkshire's incentive compensation philosophy contrasts sharply with industry practices.** Rather than fixed-price options rewarding earnings retention regardless of performance, Berkshire ties bonuses to business-unit performance independent of stock price. This aligns management with shareholders far more effectively than typical arrangements.

**Finally, Buffett's willingness to pay fair prices for exceptional management reflects maturity in his thinking.** The Cap Cities investment at $172.50 per share (contrasting with 1978-80 sales at $43) reflects recognition that some businesses and managers are worth premium valuations. Patient capital managed by first-class people can generate exceptional long-term returns even without initial bargain pricing.

The 1985 letter essentially says: "Berkshire has transitioned from a securities portfolio company hunting bargains into a diversified operator acquiring quality businesses and stakes. Historical return rates are mathematically unsustainable given our size. But we can likely achieve 15% returns by deploying capital into exceptional businesses run by exceptional people. Our insurance fortress position becomes increasingly valuable as competitors weaken. And we are willing to pay fair prices for the right businesses and the right people." This represents both humility (acknowledging constrained future returns) and confidence (believing 15% is achievable and attractive). The 1985 acquisitions—Scott & Fetzer, Capital Cities, Fireman's Fund arrangement—would prove transformational to Berkshire's future success.
