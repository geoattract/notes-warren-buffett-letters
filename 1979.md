# Berkshire Hathaway 1979 Shareholder Letter Analysis

---

**Point 1: How Did Accounting Changes Impact Berkshire’s Reported Net Worth?**

**Key Message:** New accounting rules required insurance equity securities to be carried at market value, increasing 1978 and 1979 year-end net worth substantially.

**Details:** Previously, Berkshire’s insurance subsidiaries carried equity investments at the lower of cost or market value. Now, they must be reflected at market values, even though Blue Chip Stamps—a 60% subsidiary—is not subject to this rule, creating discrepancies in consolidated statements. Buffett cautions this can cause confusion in understanding consolidated figures.

**Why It Matters:** Investors should interpret net worth figures carefully, recognizing that market-value accounting inflates book values but may introduce volatility not related to core operating business.

---

**Point 2: Why Does Berkshire Focus on Operating Earnings Relative to Cost-Based Net Worth?**

**Key Message:** Buffett believes measuring operating earnings against beginning equity with securities valued at cost is the most accurate reflection of managerial performance.

**Details:** Market-value-based net worth fluctuates with stock market swings, which can distort operating return percentages. For example, falling market values shrink the denominator, making mediocre earnings look better, while rising values do the opposite. Berkshire’s 1979 operating return was 18.6% on cost basis net worth, slightly down from 1978 but still strong.

**Why It Matters:** This maintains focus on sustainable operating performance, avoiding misleading comparisons based on volatile market valuations.

---

**Point 3: How Has Berkshire’s Long-Term Growth Performed?**

**Key Message:** Berkshire’s book value per share increased from $19.46 in 1964 to $335.85 at 1979 year-end, a 20.5% compounded annual growth rate including market value adjustments.

**Details:** This growth includes both operating earnings and capital gains, which substantially contributed to total returns. No significant leverage or share issuance occurred; growth mainly derived from starting with textile assets and acquiring 13 other businesses. Buffett notes inflation and taxes may reduce real investor returns despite high nominal growth.

**Why It Matters:** Demonstrates extraordinary value creation over 15 years, while alerting investors that inflation and tax policies can erode the real gains.

---

**Point 4: What Are the Key Sources of Berkshire’s Earnings in 1979?**

**Key Message:** Earnings grew modestly from $66 million in 1978 to $68.6 million in 1979, with insurance underwriting and investment income leading.

**Details:** Insurance underwriting profits increased from $3 million to $3.7 million, and net investment income rose from $19.7 million to $24.2 million. Retail (Associated Stores), See’s Candies, Illinois National Bank, and Wesco Financial also contributed solid gains. Textile earnings declined, and Buffalo Evening News losses worsened. Interest expense grew due to higher debt.

**Why It Matters:** Signals diversification benefits but also areas needing attention, while confirming insurance remains Berkshire’s core earnings engine.

---

**Point 5: What Is Berkshire’s Take on Its Textile & Retail Businesses?**

**Key Message:** Textiles remain a weak spot with low returns, while Associated Retail Stores consistently produce strong profits despite slow growth.

**Details:** Management admits the Waumbec Mills acquisition was a mistake due to persistent new problems despite low purchase price. Buffett emphasizes “turnarounds seldom turn” and better returns come from good businesses at fair prices rather than poor businesses at bargains. Associated Retail, managed by Ben Rosner, produces impressive cash returns on capital in a mature market.

**Why It Matters:** Reinforces Buffett’s preference for businesses with durable economic advantages and highlights the risks of turnaround investments.

---

**Point 6: How Did the Insurance Underwriting Environment Evolve in 1979?**

**Key Message:** The insurance industry faced its first underwriting loss in years, with Berkshire managing to improve relative performance slightly.

**Details:** Industry combined ratio rose from 97.4% to 100.7%, while Berkshire’s underwriting ratio improved to 97.1%. National Indemnity’s Phil Liesche led an underwriting profit of $8.4 million on $82 million premiums by selectively reducing volume. Other segments had mixed results, with problems in Homestate operations and data processing but standout results in Worker’s Compensation.

**Why It Matters:** Buffers investors against cyclical underwriting risks, illustrating the advantage of disciplined underwriting and selective volume acceptance.

---

**Point 7: What Are Berkshire’s Views on Insurance and Reinsurance Industry Risks?**

**Key Message:** Intense competition and softer pricing threaten future underwriting profitability, especially in reinsurance, which may shrink exposure.

**Details:** Berkshire warns of “disastrous results” for many reinsurance market entrants due to long loss tails and compressed rates. They plan to reduce reinsurance volume if necessary. General industry rates may settle at higher combined ratios (~105%), requiring managers to perform exceptionally to beat averages.

**Why It Matters:** Highlights the long-term challenges in insurance underwriting and the importance of strong management and disciplined risk selection.

---

**Point 8: How Does Berkshire View Its Insurance Equity Investments?**

**Key Message:** Berkshire’s insurance equity portfolio grew sharply in value and cost during the late 1970s, and while good companies remain attractive, 1980 is expected to bring portfolio underperformance.

**Details:** Equity holdings had market value of $337 million at year-end vs. $156 million cost, representing significant unrealized gains. Large stakes in companies like GEICO and SAFECO exhibit attractive economics. Buffett acknowledges possible short-term market weakness but emphasizes holding quality businesses purchased at attractive prices.

**Why It Matters:** Suggests long-term confidence in earnings power and intrinsic value despite acknowledging market fluctuations.

---

**Point 9: What Has Berkshire Learned About Long-Term Bonds in an Inflationary Economy?**

**Key Message:** Berkshire regrets investing in long-term fixed-rate bonds amid inflation, viewing them as inappropriate and potentially obsolete instruments.

**Details:** The company made mistakes buying 15-year bonds and did not sell them early when problems became clearer. Convertible bonds are preferred due to conversion options that reduce effective maturity. Buffett highlights a “cultural lag” as financial markets remain reluctant to fully account for inflation risks in long-term fixed income.

**Why It Matters:** Emphasizes the importance of understanding macroeconomic risks and correct portfolio positioning to protect capital and earnings.

---

**Point 10: How Will Berkshire Handle the Required Bank Divestiture?**

**Key Message:** Due to regulations, Berkshire must divest the Illinois National Bank by end of 1980 and is considering a sale rather than a spin-off.

**Details:** Federal Reserve restrictions prohibit management overlap between Berkshire and spun-off bank, leading Berkshire to consider selling 80-100% to a carefully chosen buyer prioritizing management continuity over price. Berkshire does not expect to replace bank earnings power with sale proceeds.

**Why It Matters:** Signals a temporary reduction in earnings and the challenge of replacing a rare, high-quality asset.

---

**Point 11: What Is Berkshire’s Philosophy on Shareholder Communication?**

**Key Message:** Buffett stresses direct communication between CEO and shareholders yearly, focusing on long-term business results rather than quarterly noise.

**Details:** Most shareholders hold their shares long-term and consider Berkshire their largest investment, warranting in-depth, candid annual reports. Buffett rejects public relations documents and short-term focus management, advocating a stable shareholder base aligned with company philosophy.

**Why It Matters:** Reinforces the long-term, owner-oriented culture that aligns management and investors.

---

**Point 12: What Are Berkshire’s Outlook and Management Structure?**

**Key Message:** Berkshire expects 1980 operating return on equity to decline from 1979 levels, with downside possible; corporate decisions are decentralized, fostering focus and agility.

**Details:** Operating results depend on bank divestiture timing, insurance underwriting continuation, and savings & loan sector issues. The company centralizes capital deployment but delegates operations to highly capable managers, leading to less bureaucracy, faster decision-making, and attraction of unique talent.

**Why It Matters:** Gives a realistic, disciplined view of challenges ahead with confidence in management structure to execute strategy.

# Executive Summary

The 1979 Berkshire Hathaway letter underscores the ongoing evolution of accounting principles, particularly the move to market-value accounting for insurance equities, which alters the presentation but not the core economic reality of the business. Buffett clarifies the focus on operating earnings relative to cost-based equity to provide consistent, meaningful performance metrics amid fluctuating market values.

Long-term, Berkshire has achieved exceptional compounded book value growth since 1964, but inflation and taxation create challenges in maintaining real investor returns, emphasizing the importance of context in evaluating results. Earnings drivers remain diversified, with insurance underwriting and investment income being key; yet, insurance faces a tough cycle with industry underwriting losses and stiff competition, especially in reinsurance.

Berkshire’s cautious stance on long-term bonds reflects its adaptability in an inflationary environment and willingness to admit mistakes. The imminent divestiture of its high-performing Illinois National Bank presents a near-term challenge in earnings replacement. Buffett’s commitment to candid, long-horizon communication with a dedicated shareholder group enhances trust and alignment.

Finally, Berkshire’s operating philosophy combines centralized capital allocation with empowered, highly talented managers running decentralised businesses, a structure designed to thrive amid complexity and economic cycles. The company anticipates a modest operating return decline in 1980 but remains confidently positioned for long-term value creation through disciplined investment and management acumen.
