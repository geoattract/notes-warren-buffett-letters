# Warren Buffett's 1979 Berkshire Hathaway Shareholder Letter: 7 Key Insights

---

## **Point 1: Accounting Changes Mask True Operating Performance**

**Key Message:** New accounting rules require marking equity securities to market value, inflating reported net worth but obscuring actual operational efficiency.

**Details:** The accounting profession mandated that insurance companies carry equity securities at market value rather than cost. While this increased Berkshire's reported 1978-1979 net worth substantially due to large unrealized gains, Buffett emphasizes this creates a distortion: "Measuring such results against shareholders' equity with securities valued at market could significantly distort the operating performance percentage because of wide year-to-year market value changes in the net worth figure." The real measure of performance should be operating earnings against beginning net worth with securities valued at cost, which showed 18.6% return in 1979—respectable but below 1978's performance.

**Why It Matters:** Investors must look beyond headline net worth figures to understand true operational performance. Market value fluctuations can make mediocre operations appear excellent or strong operations appear weak, depending on whether security values rise or fall.

## **Point 2: Per-Share Earnings Growth Is a Misleading Metric**

**Key Message:** Rising earnings per share can mask deteriorating returns on capital, making dormant businesses look like growth stocks.

**Details:** Berkshire's per-share earnings rose about 20% in 1979, yet Buffett dismisses this as "an improper figure upon which to focus." He explains: "Earnings per share will rise constantly on a dormant savings account or on a U.S. Savings Bond bearing a fixed rate of return simply because 'earnings' are continuously plowed back." The real test is "achievement of a high earnings rate on equity capital employed (without undue leverage, accounting gimmickry, etc.) and not the achievement of consistent gains in earnings per share."

**Why It Matters:** This principle remains fundamental to value investing. A company growing earnings per share while deploying more capital at lower returns is destroying shareholder value. Focus on return on equity (ROE), not earnings growth in absolute terms.

## **Point 3: Inflation and Taxes Erode Real Returns Despite Impressive Nominal Growth**

**Key Message:** A 20% annual compounded gain in book value provides near-zero real purchasing power growth when adjusted for inflation and taxes—the "investor's misery index."

**Details:** Buffett provides a sobering reality check: "If we should continue to achieve a 20% compounded gain...and this gain is translated into a corresponding increase in the market value of Berkshire Hathaway stock...your after-tax purchasing power gain is likely to be very close to zero at a 14% inflation rate." He defines an "investor's misery index" as inflation rate plus the tax rate on capital gains and dividends. When this index exceeds the business's ROE, investors lose purchasing power even while consuming nothing. He illustrates the absurdity with a gold comparison: Berkshire's 1964 book value would buy half an ounce of gold; after 15 years of plowed-back earnings and hard work, it still buys about half an ounce.

**Why It Matters:** Nominal returns are insufficient measures of success in high-inflation environments. External conditions—currency stability, tax policy, and inflation—may matter more than internal management excellence. This insight remains relevant during inflationary periods.

## **Point 4: Long-Term Value Creation Comes from Capital Appreciation and Operating Excellence**

**Key Message:** Over 15 years, Berkshire achieved 20.5% compounded annual growth in book value, reflecting both strong operations and intelligent capital deployment across 13 acquired businesses.

**Details:** From September 30, 1964 to year-end 1979, Berkshire's book value per share grew from $19.46 to $335.85—a 20.5% compounded annual return. This exceptional performance was achieved "while utilizing a low amount of leverage (both financial leverage measured by debt to equity, and operating leverage measured by premium volume to capital funds)." The company acquired 13 businesses through negotiated cash purchases from private owners and started six others. Buffett notes with grace: "It's worth a mention that those who have sold to us have, almost without exception, treated us with exceptional honor and fairness."

**Why It Matters:** Buffett demonstrates that superior long-term returns come from disciplined capital allocation, conservative leverage, and selective acquisitions—not financial engineering or accounting manipulation. The quality of relationships in business transactions matters for sustainable success.

## **Point 5: "Turnarounds Rarely Turn"—Buy Quality at Fair Prices, Not Garbage at Bargain Prices**

**Key Message:** Purchasing distressed assets at deep discounts typically underperforms investing in quality businesses at reasonable prices—a lesson learned painfully from the Waumbec Mills textile acquisition.

**Details:** Buffett admits a strategic error: "Your Chairman made the decision a few years ago to purchase Waumbec Mills in Manchester, New Hampshire, thereby expanding our textile commitment...By any statistical test, the purchase price was an extraordinary bargain; we bought well below the working capital of the business...But the purchase was a mistake. While we labored mightily, new problems arose as fast as old problems were tamed." He concludes: "Both our operating and investment experience cause us to conclude that 'turnarounds' seldom turn, and that the same energies and talent are much better employed in a good business purchased at a fair price than in a poor business purchased at a bargain price."

**Why It Matters:** This principle has profound implications for investors and M&A strategy. A cheap price doesn't compensate for structural industry problems. Buffett would later apply this lesson consistently, preferring excellent businesses with durable competitive advantages at fair prices (like See's Candies) over struggling industries.

## **Point 6: Insurance Underwriting Excellence Depends on Management Discipline and Selectivity**

**Key Message:** Exceptional insurance underwriters like Phil Liesche at National Indemnity succeed by rejecting unprofitable business rather than maximizing volume—a rare discipline in the industry.

**Details:** Phil Liesche's underwriting operation at National Indemnity produced an $8.4 million profit on $82 million in earned premiums—extraordinary results achieved despite declining volume. Buffett praises the discipline: "If business makes sense, he writes it; if it doesn't, he rejects it...Phil Liesche is an exception." Buffett contrasts this with industry-wide degradation: "The conventional wisdom is that insurance underwriting overall will be poor in 1980, but that rates will start to firm in a year or so. We disagree with this view." High interest rates encourage insurers to underwrite at losses to capture investment income, creating a race to the bottom.

**Why It Matters:** Exceptional returns in competitive industries require the willingness to walk away from business. Buffett forecasts the industry combined ratio will average 105% over the next five years, making underwriting profitability increasingly difficult. This sets up Berkshire's opportunity to outperform through disciplined managers.

## **Point 7: Long-Term Bonds Are Structurally Obsolete in an Inflationary World**

**Key Message:** Thirty and forty-year fixed-rate bonds locked in today are a catastrophic mistake in a high-inflation regime; Berkshire will no longer purchase long-term straight bonds.

**Details:** Buffett delivers a scathing critique of bond investing: "The very long-term bond contract has been the last major fixed price contract of extended duration still regularly initiated in an inflation-ridden world." He highlights the hypocrisy: Insurance companies reduced auto policies from one year to six months claiming they "can't be expected to look forward twelve months and estimate such imponderables as hospital costs, auto parts prices, etc." Yet these same managers then "sell the money at a fixed price for thirty or forty years." Buffett admits Berkshire's own mistake: "It was a mistake to buy fifteen-year bonds, and yet we did; we made an even more serious mistake in not selling them (at losses, if necessary) when our present views began to crystallize." He expresses severe doubts about long-term dollar-denominated bonds: "Those dollars...simply may have too many structural weaknesses to appropriately serve as a unit of long term commercial reference."

**Why It Matters:** This represents a fundamental shift in Berkshire's fixed-income strategy, moving toward convertible bonds (where conversion options provide an equity kicker) and away from straight debt. The insight anticipates the massive bond losses the insurance industry would suffer from the 1980s onward. Buffett's willingness to admit error and change course decisively demonstrates intellectual honesty.

## **Point 8: Corporate Culture and Shareholder Alignment Beat Trading Volume and Publicity**

**Key Message:** Berkshire intentionally attracts a stable, long-term shareholder base by communicating honestly directly from the CEO and maintaining consistent policies—the opposite of companies chasing trading volume.

**Details:** With 98% shareholder continuity year-to-year and 90% of shares representing investors' largest holdings, Berkshire can build on prior years' communications rather than restating everything annually. Buffett explains the philosophy: "In large part, companies obtain the shareholder constituency that they seek and deserve. If they focus their thinking and communications on short-term results or short-term stock market consequences they will, in large part, attract shareholders who focus on the same factors." He uses Phil Fisher's restaurant analogy: a business can't vacillate between French cuisine and take-out chicken and maintain satisfied customers. "So it is with corporations and the shareholder constituency they seek...The reasoning of managements that seek large trading activity in their shares puzzles us."

**Why It Matters:** This framework explains Berkshire's eventual success in attracting long-term capital that enabled bold, patient investments. By clearly communicating values and policies, a company self-selects its owner base. Short-term trading volume correlates with volatility and poor capital allocation decisions.

## **Point 9: Extreme Operational Delegation with Centralized Financial Control Attracts Exceptional Talent**

**Key Message:** Berkshire's unique organizational structure—minimal corporate headquarters (1,500 sq ft) with extreme delegation to operating managers and centralized financial decisions—allows it to attract and retain extraordinarily talented individuals.

**Details:** Buffett describes the approach: "Your company is run on the principle of centralization of financial decisions at the top (the very top, it might be added), and rather extreme delegation of operating authority to a number of key managers at the individual company or business unit level. We could just field a basketball team with our corporate headquarters group." This structure eliminates "large layers of costs and dramatically speeds decision-making" while enabling Berkshire to hire people "who simply can't be hired in the normal course of events—who find working for Berkshire to be almost identical to running their own show." The approach occasionally produces major mistakes but enables exceptional strategic flexibility and execution.

**Why It Matters:** This organizational innovation anticipated modern management theory and startup culture by decades. The ability to hire world-class operators (Gene Abegg at Illinois National Bank at age 82, Phil Liesche at National Indemnity) who retain autonomy and incentives is a durable competitive advantage. This structure also explains why Berkshire could grow without the typical corporate bloat and bureaucracy that destroys value.

## **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**

Warren Buffett's 1979 shareholder letter captures Berkshire Hathaway at an inflection point—transitioning from a textile company into an exceptional capital allocator and insurance powerhouse. The letter is remarkable for its intellectual honesty: Buffett explicitly acknowledges mistakes (Waumbec Mills acquisition, long-term bond purchases) and expresses uncertainty about future returns in an inflationary environment.

Three overarching themes emerge. **First, honest financial reporting and metric selection matter enormously.** Buffett rejects misleading accounting conventions and per-share earnings growth as performance measures, instead focusing on return on equity—a principle that separates thinking investors from passive analysts. **Second, structural inflation represents an existential threat to investment returns that no amount of operational excellence can fully overcome.** His "investor's misery index" framework remains relevant forty years later, explaining why nominal returns of 20%+ produce near-zero real purchasing power gains. This recognition drives his pivot away from long-term fixed-rate bonds, a prescient call given the 1980s bond market collapse.

**Third, competitive advantage comes not from financial manipulation but from operational discipline, quality management, and patient capital.** Whether in insurance underwriting (rejecting unprofitable business), acquisitions (seeking quality at fair prices rather than garbage at bargain prices), or organizational design (extreme delegation with minimal corporate overhead), Buffett demonstrates that sustainable outperformance requires alignment of incentives, clarity of values, and the discipline to say no. The letter's emphasis on attracting and retaining a stable shareholder base through consistent communication and honest disclosure reveals that culture and trust—not quarterly earnings surprises—create lasting value. This philosophy would guide Berkshire's remarkable multi-decade outperformance and remains relevant for any investor or manager seeking to build enduring enterprises.
