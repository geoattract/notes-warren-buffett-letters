# Berkshire Hathaway 1993 Shareholder Letter Analysis

## Seven Major Valuable Insights for Investors

---

### **Point 1: Market Price vs. Intrinsic Value—The Divergence and the Long View**

**Key Message:** Stock market prices can dramatically diverge from intrinsic value in the short term, but Ben Graham's insight that "in the long-run, the market is a weighing machine" ultimately prevails.

**Details:** Berkshire's per-share book value grew 14.3% in 1993 (roughly 14% intrinsic value growth), yet the market price jumped 39%. Buffett explains this divergence through historical perspective: Coca-Cola went public at $40 in 1919, dropped to $19.50 by 1920 (despite no change in business fundamentals), yet that single share with reinvested dividends was worth $2.1 million by yearend 1993. The letter notes that Coke's market price from 1991-1993 underperformed its business performance: while the company increased operating earnings per share by 38%, the stock rose only 11%. Buffett clarifies: "What will count over time is the earnings performance of these companies. If they prosper, Berkshire will also prosper, though not in a lock-step manner."

**Why It Matters:** This insight teaches investors to distinguish between short-term market speculation and long-term value creation. It provides historical context for patience during market downturns and humility during rallies, revealing that volatility creates opportunity for disciplined investors who focus on business fundamentals rather than price movements.

### **Point 2: The Discipline of "Easy to Understand" Businesses**

**Key Message:** Rather than trying to predict future winners in complex industries, focus exclusively on businesses whose competitive advantages and economics you can reliably evaluate.

**Details:** In discussing Dexter Shoe, Berkshire's 1993 major acquisition, Buffett emphasizes that the business "needs no fixing" and is "one of the best-managed companies Charlie and I have seen in our business lifetimes." Harold Alfond founded Dexter in 1956 with $10,000 and built it to produce 7.5 million pairs annually, competing globally despite the prevailing wisdom that domestic shoe manufacturing cannot compete with low-wage countries. Buffett explains Berkshire's acquisition philosophy: "At Berkshire, we have no view of the future that dictates what businesses or industries we will enter...We prefer instead to focus on the economic characteristics of businesses that we wish to own and the personal characteristics of managers with whom we wish to associate." He explicitly states why they avoid complex industries: "a business that must deal with fast-moving technology is not going to lend itself to reliable evaluations of its long-term economics. Did we foresee thirty years ago what would transpire in the television-manufacturing or computer industries? Of course not."

**Why It Matters:** For investors, this principle reveals that competitive advantage comes from understanding what you can and cannot reliably predict. By confining themselves to "easy cases," Berkshire and its shareholders reduce the risk of catastrophic misjudgment. This insight challenges the notion that sophisticated investors must understand cutting-edge industries—the opposite is often true.

### **Point 3: Look-Through Earnings—The True Economic Story**

**Key Message:** Traditional GAAP accounting obscures Berkshire's true earning power; look-through earnings (including retained earnings of investees) provide a more accurate picture of economic value creation.

**Details:** Berkshire's look-through earnings in 1993 were $856 million, compared to $604 million in 1992 (41% growth). This metric includes: (1) operating earnings ($478M), plus (2) retained operating earnings of major investees ($439M), less (3) hypothetical taxes on those retained earnings ($61M). The letter explains that to meet Berkshire's 15% annual intrinsic value growth target, look-through earnings must reach approximately $1.85 billion by 2000. A striking example: Berkshire bought three million Capital Cities/ABC shares in 1986 for $172.50 each, selling one-third in 1993 for $630 per share, realizing a $297 million profit after 35% capital gains taxes. Yet during the eight-year holding period, the retained earnings attributable to these shares—hypothetically taxed at 14%—were only $152 million. This demonstrates that market gains often far exceed the conservative look-through accounting estimates, validating the methodology as conservative.

**Why It Matters:** For investors analyzing diversified holding companies, traditional accounting metrics can be misleading. Look-through earnings reveal the true economic earning power and can predict future gains more accurately. This framework is particularly valuable when assessing whether management's long-term capital allocation is paying off.

### **Point 4: Insurance Float—Still the Cheapest Capital, But With Major Caveats**

**Key Message:** While float remains exceptionally valuable capital, the super-catastrophe business carries tail risks that could produce years with losses exceeding several years of profits.

**Details:** Berkshire generated $2.6 billion of float in 1993 at negative cost—the company was paid $31 million (underwriting profit) to hold policyholders' funds. However, Buffett emphasizes the danger of misinterpreting one profitable year: "A simple example will illustrate the fallacy: Suppose there is an event that occurs 25 times in every century. If you annually give 5-for-1 odds against its occurrence that year, you will have many more winning years than losers...You also will eventually go broke." He explains that while Berkshire believes it's obtaining adequate premiums and giving roughly 3.5-for-1 odds, "there is no way for us - or anyone else - to calculate the true odds on super-cat coverages." Critically, because Berkshire has expanded super-catastrophe capacity since Hurricane Andrew's $125 million loss in 1992, "a similar storm today could cost us $600 million." The 1993 midwestern floods did not trigger super-cat losses because "very few flood policies are purchased from private insurers."

**Why It Matters:** This insight reveals that exceptional returns often hide exceptional risks. Investors should be deeply skeptical of concentrated businesses showing consistent profitability without considering tail risks. It demonstrates Berkshire's intellectual honesty—openly acknowledging that future years could produce massive losses from their most profitable division.

### **Point 5: Beta-Based Risk Theory Misses the Point Entirely**

**Key Message:** Academic risk models using stock price volatility (beta) are fundamentally flawed; true investment risk relates to the permanent loss of purchasing power, determined by business economics and competitive advantages, not price fluctuations.

**Details:** Buffett launches a comprehensive attack on beta theory: "For owners of a business - and that's the way we think of shareholders - the academics' definition of risk is far off the mark, so much so that it produces absurdities. For example, under beta-based theory, a stock that has dropped very sharply compared to the market...becomes 'riskier' at the lower price than it was at the higher price. Would that description have then made any sense to someone who was offered the entire company at a vastly-reduced price?" He contrasts this with genuine risk factors: (1) certainty of long-term economic characteristics; (2) certainty of management quality; (3) certainty of capital allocation to shareholders; (4) purchase price; and (5) taxation and inflation levels. Using Coca-Cola and Gillette examples, Buffett notes they have 44% and 60%+ market shares respectively, with moats protecting them from competition. Yet beta theory treats their stock risk similarly to "run-of-the-mill companies who possess little or no competitive advantage."

**Why It Matters:** For investors, this critique justifies concentrating in high-confidence, low-risk businesses with durable competitive advantages. It reveals that academic models can actually mislead investors by conflating volatility with risk. True risk management requires deep analysis of business fundamentals, not mathematical shortcuts.

### **Point 6: Portfolio Concentration vs. Diversification—Choosing the Right Strategy**

**Key Message:** For investors who deeply understand businesses and can identify 5-10 high-quality, understandable companies, concentrated portfolios reduce risk and increase returns compared to conventional diversification.

**Details:** Buffett presents a framework for portfolio strategy: if you're a "know-nothing investor" who doesn't understand specific business economics, you should diversify broadly into index funds and periodic dollar-cost averaging—"dumb money acknowledges its limitations, it ceases to be dumb." However, if you're a "know-something investor" who can find "five to ten sensibly-priced companies that possess important long-term competitive advantages," then "conventional diversification makes no sense for you. It is apt simply to hurt your results and increase your risk." He uses Mae West's observation: "Too much of a good thing can be wonderful." The letter notes that "Charlie and I decided long ago that in an investment lifetime it's just too hard to make hundreds of smart decisions...we'll now settle for one good idea a year." By requiring only a few correct decisions while avoiding major mistakes, concentration allows diligent investors to outperform despite making fewer investment decisions than diversified portfolios.

**Why It Matters:** This insight offers permission and a framework for concentrated investing when appropriate. It acknowledges that different strategies suit different investor skill levels. For sophisticated investors, it validates the superiority of deep knowledge over broad diversification, while for ordinary investors, it recommends humble index-fund approaches.

### **Point 7: Corporate Governance—Three Fundamentally Different Models**

**Key Message:** The effectiveness of board oversight depends critically on whether there is a controlling shareholder and whether that shareholder is also the manager—each configuration requires different governance expectations.

**Details:** Buffett identifies three governance models: (1) No controlling shareholder (most common)—directors act as agents for an "absentee owner," with responsibility to evaluate management and make changes; (2) Controlling owner is also the manager (Berkshire's current structure)—directors have limited power and can only persuade; if serious issues arise, outside directors may need to resign to signal their concerns; (3) Controlling owner is non-manager (like Hershey Foods, Dow Jones)—this is "ideal for an outside director" since dissatisfied directors can report directly to the owner. Buffett explains: "Logically, the third case should be the most effective in insuring first-class management." He discloses that Berkshire operates in mode 2 (owner/manager) and "will for as long as I remain functional. My health, let me add, is excellent." Planning for eventual transition to mode 3, he notes that "When my stock is transferred to either my wife or the foundation, Berkshire will enter the third governance mode." Susie (his wife) was elected to the board, and Howard (their son) joined in 1993.

**Why It Matters:** For shareholders of public companies, this framework reveals why governance effectiveness varies dramatically across companies despite similar board structures. It explains why board criticism of a founder/CEO may be ineffective and when shareholder activism might succeed. For Berkshire shareholders, it provides transparency about succession planning and governance transition.

### **Point 8: Shareholder-Designated Charitable Giving—Aligning Corporate and Individual Values**

**Key Message:** Company funds belong to shareholders; shareholders, not CEOs or directors, should direct discretionary philanthropy, making charitable giving both more aligned with owner values and more tax-efficient.

**Details:** In 1993, 97% of eligible Berkshire shares participated in the shareholder-directed contributions program, distributing $9.4 million to 3,110 charities. Buffett explains the philosophy: "At Berkshire, we believe that the company's money is the owners' money, just as it would be in a closely-held corporation, partnership, or sole proprietorship. Therefore, if funds are to be given to causes unrelated to Berkshire's business activities, it is the charities favored by our owners that should receive them." The contribution categories show shareholder preferences: churches/synagogues (569 gifts), colleges/universities (670 gifts), K-12 schools (525 gifts), secular social services (759 gifts). Notably, Buffett observes: "The contributions programs of publicly-held companies almost never allow gifts to churches and synagogues, yet clearly these institutions are what many shareholders would like to support." The program required borrowing only one person for two months annually—far less administrative burden than corporate matching-gift programs. After shareholder feedback emphasizing tax efficiency and educational value for younger shareholders, Berkshire increased the designated amount from $8 to $10 per share in 1993.

**Why It Matters:** This insight reveals how corporate policies can better align with shareholder interests through structural changes. It demonstrates that efficient philanthropy requires respecting shareholder autonomy and recognizing that collective values are more diverse than CEO preferences. For shareholders, it illustrates how concentrated ownership can implement owner-friendly policies that diffuse shareholders might struggle to demand.

### **Point 9: Accounting Rule Changes—Hidden Impacts on Reported Earnings**

**Key Message:** Changes in Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) can materially affect reported earnings without changing underlying business economics, creating potential confusion for investors unfamiliar with accounting mechanics.

**Details:** Berkshire's 1993 reported earnings of $688 million included significant accounting adjustments unrelated to business performance: (1) Deferred tax change requiring application of 35% tax rate to all unrealized gains reduced net worth by $70 million; (2) Corporate tax rate increase from 34% to 35% triggered an additional $75 million charge against unrealized appreciation (paradoxically, GAAP deducted these charges from reported earnings though the unrealized appreciation was never included in earnings to begin with); (3) New GAAP rule requiring all common stocks to be valued at market (not cost or market, whichever is lower) produced a $172 million gain; (4) Share issuances from Dexter Shoe acquisition added 25,203 shares. Buffett explains that "It's per-share intrinsic value, not book value, that counts" and that while book value "serves as a useful device for tracking" intrinsic value, the two can diverge significantly. The letter explicitly notes that reported operating earnings of $477.751 million exclude $356.702 million in securities gains and $146.332 million in tax accrual charges.

**Why It Matters:** For sophisticated investors analyzing earnings reports, this demonstrates the critical importance of understanding accounting mechanics. Non-cash charges and one-time adjustments can obscure underlying business performance. Buffett's detailed explanation models the transparency investors should demand, revealing that many companies bury such items in footnotes or consolidated figures.

## Executive Summary

Warren Buffett's 1993 shareholder letter continues to be a masterclass in disciplined investing, but adds nuance to earlier lessons through fresh examples and expanded frameworks. The centerpiece is the tension between short-term market volatility and long-term business value creation—exemplified by stock prices diverging 39% from intrinsic value while underlying businesses maintained roughly 14% growth. Buffett reinforces Ben Graham's wisdom that markets act as "voting machines" in the short run but "weighing machines" over decades, illustrated powerfully by Coca-Cola's 50-year journey from $19.50 to over $2 million per share (with dividends reinvested).

The Dexter Shoe acquisition exemplifies Berkshire's refined acquisition discipline: buying only businesses that are already well-managed, with durable competitive advantages, in industries the company thoroughly understands. Rather than betting on transformation or industry trends, Berkshire focuses on owner-operators running excellent businesses. This philosophy explicitly rejects the seductive appeal of complex, fast-moving industries where prediction is impossible. Importantly, the letter introduces "look-through earnings"—a more accurate measure of economic value creation that includes retained earnings of investees. This framework reveals that Berkshire's true earning power exceeds reported GAAP earnings, with the company generating $856 million in look-through earnings in 1993.

A critical and refreshingly honest section addresses insurance float's hidden dangers. While Berkshire generated $2.6 billion of float at negative cost, Buffett warns that the super-catastrophe business's apparent profitability masks tail risks: a catastrophe only slightly larger than Hurricane Andrew could cost $600 million versus the $125 million loss in 1992. This intellectual honesty about concentrated risks contrasts sharply with how most corporations present their operations. Buffett's comprehensive critique of beta-based risk theory further distinguishes his philosophy: true investment risk relates to permanent loss of purchasing power driven by business economics and competitive moats, not stock price volatility. Companies with durable competitive advantages (Coca-Cola, Gillette) carry far less risk than beta theory suggests, while seemingly stable businesses without moats hide substantial risk.

The letter extends Berkshire's philosophy to portfolio strategy, defending concentrated investing for knowledgeable investors while recommending index funds for those who lack deep business understanding. It introduces three corporate governance models and maps Berkshire's succession plan, revealing that Susie and Howard are positioned to lead governance transition after Buffett's tenure. Finally, the shareholder-designated contributions program exemplifies how corporate structure can align company values with owner values, allowing 97% participation in directing $9.4 million to 3,110 charities—demonstrating both efficiency and respect for shareholder autonomy. Through these diverse topics, the 1993 letter emphasizes that sustainable wealth creation requires: intellectual honesty about risks, discipline in understanding what you can and cannot predict, concentration in high-conviction, low-risk businesses, and alignment of corporate policies with long-term shareholder interests.
