# Berkshire Hathaway 1998 Shareholder Letter: 9 Essential Insights

## **Point 1: The Book Value Illusion – Why Per-Share Metrics Can Deceive**

**Key Message:** A 48.3% gain in per-share book value masks the reality that most growth came from share issuance, not operational excellence or intrinsic value creation.

**Details:** Buffett opens with a candid confession: "Berkshire's progress in 1998 – though more than satisfactory – was not as good as it looks." Because Berkshire's stock trades at a premium to book value, issuing shares in acquisitions artificially inflates per-share book value figures even when no economic value is created. While book value per share grew 48.3%, the real measure—per-share intrinsic value—grew substantially but fell well short of that headline number. This distinction matters because "it's the per-share gain in intrinsic value that counts rather than the per-share gain in book value."

**Why It Matters:** Investors often fixate on headline growth metrics without understanding the underlying mechanics. This insight reveals how companies can game reported growth through financial engineering, emphasizing why shareholders must look beyond accounting metrics to true economic value creation.

## **Point 2: A Realistic View on Future Returns – The Math of Scale**

**Key Message:** Berkshire's future growth rates will fall dramatically short of past performance because the company has become too large to generate outsized returns.

**Details:** With a capital base of $57.4 billion (the largest of any American corporation at the time), Buffett states plainly: "Our future rates of gain will fall far short of those achieved in the past." He commits to a realistic target of 15% annual average returns going forward—describing this as "at the very peak of possible outcomes." To achieve 15% compounded growth, Berkshire would need to increase net worth by $58 billion over five years. Buffett emphasizes the mathematical reality: "If you believe otherwise, you should consider a career in sales but avoid one in mathematics (bearing in mind that there are really only three kinds of people in the world: those who can count and those who can't)."

**Why It Matters:** This demonstrates intellectual honesty rare in corporate leadership. Rather than overpromising, Buffett calibrates expectations based on mathematical realities. For investors, this is both refreshing and instructive—acknowledging that past 24.7% annual returns cannot persist indefinitely.

## **Point 3: GEICO's Explosive Growth – The Power of Operational Leverage**

**Key Message:** GEICO transformed from an acquired turnaround into a powerhouse by combining low-cost operations with aggressive, profitable growth investing.

**Details:** GEICO's new auto policies exploded from 461,608 in 1995 (pre-acquisition) to 1,317,761 in 1998. Marketing spend surged from $33 million to $143 million, with telephone counselors increasing from 652 to 2,162. Despite this investment, GEICO maintained a 6.7% profit margin and generated profit-sharing payments of 32.3% of salary to employees with more than a year tenure. Buffett notes that "about 40% of those who check our rates find that they can save money by doing business with us," and GEICO's complaint ratio was less than half the average of its four largest competitors in New York.

**Why It Matters:** GEICO exemplifies how Berkshire's ownership structure enables long-term thinking. Because Berkshire doesn't fixate on quarterly earnings, GEICO can invest heavily in first-year acquisition costs that are unprofitable upfront but generate decades of profits as policies renew. Most public companies would never make such investments due to short-term earnings pressure.

## **Point 4: The Fractional Jet Revolution – Executive Jet Aviation's Potential**

**Key Message:** Executive Jet's fractional jet ownership model has barely tapped its enormous addressable market, representing massive long-term growth potential.

**Details:** Through the $725 million acquisition of Executive Jet Aviation, Berkshire entered the fractional aircraft ownership business. Rich Santulli created this industry in 1986. EJA operates 163 aircraft for over 1,000 customers with a unique advantage: unlike competitors owned by manufacturers, NetJets can offer planes from Boeing, Gulfstream, Falcon, Cessna, and Raytheon. In 1997 alone, EJA accounted for 31% of all corporate jets ordered globally. Buffett estimates that if millions find it sensible to own 100% of a plane, an even larger multiple must find fractional ownership economical. He adds a personal endorsement: "Quite simply, they love this service," based on his family flying 900 hours on 300 trips.

**Why It Matters:** This acquisition demonstrates Buffett's strategy of backing exceptional managers (Santulli needed no economic incentive to continue) in industries with sustainable competitive advantages and tremendous runway for growth—a textbook Berkshire move.

## **Point 5: Insurance Float as a Business Model – The Economics of Other People's Money**

**Key Message:** Float—premiums collected before claims are paid—is Berkshire's most valuable asset when the cost is below market rates for capital.

**Details:** Berkshire's float grew from $17 million in 1967 to $22.762 billion at year-end 1998, growing at 25.4% compounded annually. More importantly, Berkshire's average cost of float over 32 years has been "well under zero"—meaning the company posted substantial underwriting profits. This is "the best of all worlds" because the float is recorded as a liability on the balance sheet yet has delivered more economic value than an equivalent amount of net worth. The reinsurance business works because Berkshire accepts earnings volatility that public-company reinsurers reject: "We prefer a lumpy 15% return to a smooth 12%."

**Why It Matters:** Float is the secret engine of Berkshire's value creation. Unlike most insurance companies that treat float as a cost center, Berkshire weaponizes it through disciplined underwriting. This insight explains why insurance is central to Berkshire's economic moat and why the General Re acquisition—adding $2/3rds of Berkshire's total float—was transformational.

## **Point 6: The General Re Acquisition – Buying Distribution and Stability**

**Key Message:** The $22 billion General Re acquisition provides Berkshire with distribution infrastructure and management excellence to deploy its unique capital structure globally.

**Details:** By acquiring General Re (including 82% of Cologne Re), Berkshire gained the world's largest U.S. property-casualty reinsurer operating in 124 countries. While General Re had an underwriting loss in 1998, Buffett explains the strategic logic: General Re's management couldn't optimize the business because public markets penalize reinsurers for earnings volatility. Berkshire's structure—described as a "Fort Knox of capital"—eliminates this constraint. General Re can now "accelerate their push into international markets, where the preponderance of industry growth will almost certainly occur." Buffett notes: "the most compelling reason for the merger is simply that General Re's outstanding management can now do what it does best, unfettered by the constraints that have limited its growth."

**Why It Matters:** This reveals Buffett's M&A strategy: buy great managers trapped in structures that constrain them, then liberate them with patient capital and freedom. General Re's $26 million underwriting loss in 1998 barely troubled Buffett because he focuses on 10-year prospects, not annual results.

## **Point 7: The Accounting Fraud Epidemic – How "Restructuring Charges" Manipulate Earnings**

**Key Message:** Corporate America faces an integrity crisis as executives and auditors increasingly manipulate earnings through accounting shenanigans disguised as legitimate business practices.

**Details:** Buffett launches a scathing critique of "restructuring charges"—the practice of dumping years of costs into a single quarter, typically one already disappointing investors, to set up future earnings surprises. He compares this to a golfer who shoots 140 in his first round to establish a "reserve," then counts only good holes going forward. A preliminary tally identified 1,369 special charges in 1998 totaling $72.1 billion—nearly 22% of Fortune 500 companies' combined 1997 earnings. Buffett condemns managements for fighting the Financial Accounting Standards Board's attempts to require stock-option expensing, and he excoriates auditors for kowtowing to their fee-paying clients rather than serving investors. He praises SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt's campaign against "earnings management," calling it "hard to think of another more important" task.

**Why It Matters:** Written in 1998, this prescient critique anticipated the Enron and WorldCom scandals of 2001-2002 by years. Buffett's warning that "bad accounting drives out good" (his phrase "Son of Gresham") explains why investors cannot trust reported earnings without deep analysis of the underlying business.

## **Point 8: The Stock Option Tragedy – An Invisible but Massive Expense**

**Key Message:** Stock options represent a huge corporate expense that accounting rules systematically ignore, distorting earnings and shareholder returns.

**Details:** Berkshire discovered upon acquiring General Re that it must replace the company's stock option plan with cash compensation. While economically equivalent, the accounting treatment differs dramatically: the cash option produces a $63 million charge to earnings, while the option grants had produced zero recorded expense. Buffett illustrates the absurdity: "Suppose that instead of paying cash for our ads, we paid the media in ten-year, at-the-market Berkshire options. Would anyone then care to argue that Berkshire had not borne a cost for advertising, or should not be charged this cost on its books?" He reveals that his earnings adjustments for options have frequently reduced reported per-share figures by 5%, with 10% "not all that uncommon," sometimes significantly affecting investment decisions.

**Why It Matters:** This structural distortion in accounting inflates corporate earnings across the economy. Investors who rely on reported earnings risk significant overvaluation, as true economic costs remain invisible—a problem that persists today despite later accounting reforms.

## **Point 9: The Shareholder Base is the Moat – Why Berkshire Can Think Differently**

**Key Message:** Berkshire's unique shareholder base—dominated by long-term holders—is itself a competitive advantage that enables management to prioritize long-term value over quarterly earnings.

**Details:** Buffett notes that "a majority of our shares are held by investors who expect to die still holding them," giving Berkshire "the longest investment horizon to be found in the public-company universe." This permits the company to ask CEOs to "manage for maximum long-term value, rather than for next quarter's earnings." Buffett argues this approach attracts elite managers like GEICO's Tony Nicely and Executive Jet's Rich Santulli—both independently wealthy individuals who work because they love their businesses, not for compensation. This environment of freedom attracts exceptional talent: "In this environment of freedom, both Tony and his company can convert their almost limitless potential into matching achievements."

**Why It Matters:** This insight reveals that Berkshire's ownership structure is itself a business advantage, creating a virtuous cycle: long-term shareholders attract exceptional managers, who build sustainable competitive advantages, which attract more long-term shareholders. Few corporations can replicate this—it requires sustained shareholder activism to resist short-termism.

## **Executive Summary**

Warren Buffett's 1998 letter captures Berkshire at an inflection point: a $57.4 billion colossus confronting the mathematical reality that past performance cannot persist, yet discovering through strategic acquisitions (General Re, Executive Jet) and operational excellence (GEICO) that enormous opportunities remain.

The letter's core tension is refreshing honesty about constraints coupled with aggressive opportunism within them. Buffett candidly admits that Berkshire's 48.3% book value growth was largely illusory—driven by share issuance rather than intrinsic value creation—and projects 15% annual returns going forward as "the very peak of possible outcomes." Yet within these realistic bounds, the company is executing brilliantly: GEICO is reinventing auto insurance through patient, profitable growth; General Re provides a global distribution platform for Berkshire's unique capital structure; and Executive Jet is pioneering a new industry with years of expansion ahead.

Offsetting these operational achievements, Buffett issues a scathing indictment of corporate America's integrity crisis. He documents an epidemic of accounting manipulation, from stock-option expensing sleights-of-hand to fraudulent restructuring charges designed to game Wall Street expectations. The 1,369 special charges taken in 1998 alone ($72.1 billion) represent nearly a quarter of Fortune 500 earnings—an incomprehensible distortion. He praises SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt's campaign for truth in accounting, implicitly warning that "bad accounting drives out good" and that investors relying on reported earnings do so at their peril.

The letter culminates in a subtle but profound insight: Berkshire's shareholder base—dominated by long-term holders expecting to die holding their shares—is itself a competitive moat. This unique ownership structure enables management to reject the short-term earnings manipulation plaguing corporate America, attract the world's best managers, and compound wealth over decades. For investors seeking to understand why Berkshire has outperformed dramatically, this framing matters more than any metric: the company's culture of patience and integrity attracts exceptional people and long-term capital, which in turn compound the advantage. In an era of widespread corporate deception, Berkshire's commitment to straight dealing and long-term value is not just ethically correct—it is economically superior.
