# Berkshire Hathaway 1991 Shareholder Letter: 9 Key Insights

## **Insight 1: The Capital Base Problem Becomes Critical—$370 Million Required for One Percentage Point**

**Key Message:** As Berkshire's equity capital grows to $7.4 billion, the company requires ever-larger opportunities to move the needle, making 15% annual returns mathematically increasingly difficult.

**Details:** Buffett provides stark mathematics: when working with $20 million capital, a $1 million profit idea added 5 percentage points to annual returns. Now with $7.4 billion in capital, the same $1 million idea adds only 0.01 percentage points. To achieve one percentage point of return improvement requires $370 million in pre-tax profit. To maintain 15% annual growth in book value over the next decade, Berkshire must earn $22 billion—an enormous absolute number. Buffett acknowledges: "The size of our equity capital makes it certain that we cannot maintain our past rate of gain or, for that matter, come close to doing so. As Berkshire grows, the universe of opportunities that can significantly influence the company's performance constantly shrinks."

**Why It Matters:** This mathematical reality explains why high growth rates must eventually decelerate. No company can maintain 23.7% annual returns indefinitely from an ever-growing capital base. The problem isn't management quality or investment opportunity scarcity in absolute terms—it's that opportunities large enough to move a $7.4 billion capital base at 15% returns are extraordinarily rare.

## **Insight 2: The Coca-Cola and Gillette "Double-Dip" Cannot Repeat**

**Key Message:** 1991's outsized 39.6% return resulted from valuation expansion (P/E multiple increases) on top of earnings growth; this two-component bonus cannot recur annually.

**Details:** Coca-Cola and Gillette stock price appreciation accounted for nearly $1.6 billion of Berkshire's $2.1 billion net worth gain in 1991. Buffett explicitly states: "we got a double-dip benefit, delivered partly by the excellent earnings growth and even more so by the market's reappraisal of these stocks." The reappraisal was warranted—both companies merit premium valuations. However, "it can't recur annually: We'll have to settle for a single dip in the future." When Berkshire bought Coca-Cola, the company's intrinsic value exceeded its stock price; now the stock price reflects full recognition of Coca-Cola's quality. Similarly with Gillette. Future returns will come from business earnings growth alone, not from multiple expansion.

**Why It Matters:** This distinguishes between sustainable returns (based on business value creation) and temporary windfalls (based on market repricing). The double-dip benefit explains much of Berkshire's extraordinary past performance and won't repeat, fundamentally altering expectations for future returns.

## **Insight 3: The Salomon Crisis—Buffett's Interim Chairmanship as Confidence Signal**

**Key Message:** Taking the Interim Chairman role at Salomon demonstrates that Berkshire's operating managers are so exceptional that Buffett can reduce his time involvement without affecting the company's performance.

**Details:** On August 18, 1991, Buffett became Interim Chairman of Salomon Inc amid a Treasury auction bidding scandal. He explains this decision carried "an implicit but important message: Berkshire's operating managers are so outstanding that I knew I could materially reduce the time I was spending at the company and yet remain confident that its economic progress would not skip a beat." The Blumkins, Friedman family, Mike Goldberg, Heldmans, Chuck Huggins, Stan Lipsey, Ralph Schey, and Frank Rooney need no operational help from Buffett—his only roles are treating them well and allocating capital. He illustrates this with a George Mira story: after being tackled and losing his right shoulder, Miami quarterback Mira switched the ball to his left hand and threw a touchdown pass. Coach Andy Gustafson observed: "Now that's what I call coaching." Buffett's point: with exceptional managers, leadership is about staying out of the way.

**Why It Matters:** This reveals Berkshire's organizational structure: exceptional operating managers run their businesses autonomously while Buffett focuses on capital allocation. The willingness to take on an external crisis role demonstrates confidence in the operating team and shows that Berkshire's success doesn't depend on Buffett's operational involvement.

## **Insight 4: Look-Through Earnings Framework—1991's 14% Decline Reveals True Performance**

**Key Message:** Reported operating earnings of $316 million mask the company's true $516 million look-through earnings, with the 14% decline revealing real challenges beyond reported accounting.

**Details:** Buffett's look-through earnings calculation adds retained earnings of major investees (minus hypothetical taxes) to reported operating earnings. In 1991, this totaled $516 million (down from $602 million in 1990). The decline had four causes: (1) media earnings declined as predicted; (2) Gillette preferred conversion on April 1 reduced earnings by ~$45 million; (3) Wells Fargo break-even result (dividends offset by retained earnings); (4) lower insurance profits. The table shows that major investees' undistributed earnings totaled $230 million (down from $266 million), with significant declines at Capital Cities ($61M vs $85M) and Wells Fargo (negative $17M vs positive $19M). Buffett stresses that over 27 years, look-through earnings have grown at 23% annually, matching book value growth, demonstrating the measure's validity.

**Why It Matters:** This framework reveals that standard GAAP reporting significantly understates true economic performance. Investors focusing only on reported operating earnings of $316 million would miss that true earning power is 63% higher at $516 million. More importantly, the framework explains why retained earnings of exceptional managers at investee companies create shareholder value despite not appearing in Berkshire's earnings.

## **Insight 5: Media Industry Transformation—From Franchise to Business**

**Key Message:** Media properties have fundamentally shifted from economic franchises (sustainable pricing power) to businesses (vulnerable to competition), reducing intrinsic values permanently.

**Details:** Buffett defines an economic franchise as a product/service that: (1) is needed or desired; (2) has no close substitute; (3) is not price-regulated. Such franchises can tolerate mismanagement and price aggressively. In contrast, "a business" earns profits only if it's the low-cost operator or faces supply tightness—both temporary conditions. Media previously possessed franchise characteristics but now faces: (1) advertising dollars growing slowly; (2) retailers using direct mail rather than media advertising; (3) greatly increased advertising channels (print and electronic) fragmenting audiences. With 500 million American eyeballs and 24 hours per day fixed, expanded supply cannot increase demand. Result: "competition has intensified, markets have fragmented, and the media industry has lost some—though far from all—of its franchise strength."

Buffett provides valuation math: a media property with $1 million earnings, assuming 6% perpetual growth without additional capital, could justify $25 million valuation (25x after-tax multiple). But if earnings merely "bob around" cyclically (the new reality), the same $1 million cash flow justifies only $10 million valuation (10x after-tax). This "seemingly modest shift in assumptions reduces the property's valuation" by 60%. Berkshire's media investments (Buffalo News, Capital Cities, Washington Post) have declined in intrinsic value, though management quality and strong balance sheets moderate the decline.

**Why It Matters:** This illustrates how structural industry changes can permanently reduce business values independent of management quality. Buffett's refusal to sell permanent holdings despite intrinsic value decline demonstrates philosophical consistency, even when acknowledging business model deterioration.

## **Insight 6: See's Candies Twenty-Year Retrospective—The Franchise Model in Action**

**Key Message:** See's demonstrates how exceptional managers operating within strong economic franchises can compound capital at extraordinary rates with minimal reinvestment.

**Details:** In January 1972, Berkshire purchased See's for $25 million (nominal $40 million less $10 million excess cash). The company had only $7 million of tangible net worth. Over 20 years: sales grew from $29 million to $196 million; pre-tax profits grew from $4.2 million to $42.4 million. Critically, net worth required only $25 million (just $18 million of reinvested earnings beyond the original $7 million), while pre-tax profits of $410 million were distributed to Berkshire. This enabled 57x multiplication of profits ($4.2M to $42.4M) with just 3.6x multiplication of capital employed ($7M to $25M). In 1991, See's sales matched prior year in dollars but declined 4% in pounds; a weak December (which normally generates 80% of annual profits) hurt volume. Despite sales weakness, pre-tax profits grew 7%, and profit margins reached a record 21.6%. A California sales tax on "snack food" (but not "non-snack food," leading to absurd classifications like taxable Ritz Crackers versus non-taxable Soda Crackers) hurt sales late in the year.

Buffett credits the See's investment with teaching crucial lessons about franchise valuation: "Ownership of See's has taught us much about the evaluation of franchises. We've made significant money in certain common stocks because of the lessons we learned at See's."

**Why It Matters:** See's exemplifies how exceptional managers within strong franchises can deliver extraordinary returns without requiring significant incremental capital. The minimal reinvestment requirement and massive cash distributions demonstrate the power of franchise economics versus typical businesses.

## **Insight 7: H.H. Brown Acquisition—The Salesman Without the Hat**

**Key Message:** H.H. Brown acquisition demonstrates Berkshire's preference for family businesses with exceptional multi-generational management and unusual incentive alignment.

**Details:** Berkshire acquired H.H. Brown in 1991, a work shoe manufacturer founded in 1927. The company's story: Ray Heffernan purchased it for $10,000 in 1927 and ran it for 62 years, eventually generating $25 million annual pre-tax earnings. His daughter Frances married Frank Rooney, whom Heffernan warned "had better forget any ideas about working for his father-in-law." Rooney instead became CEO of Melville Shoe (1964-1986), delivering 20%+ annual returns and stock appreciation from $16 to $960. After Heffernan's death in 1990, Rooney agreed to run Brown. Buffett's connection came through John Loomis (a Berkshire shareholder and Rooney's golf partner in Florida) who suggested the fit.

What distinguishes H.H. Brown: an unusual compensation system where key managers receive $7,800 annual salary plus a percentage of profits after capital charges—making them "truly stand in the shoes of owners." This aligns manager interests precisely with shareholder interests, creating "owners who happen to be employees" rather than "employees paid to act like owners." The shoe industry is brutally competitive (85% of U.S. shoes imported) with heavy inventory and receivables, requiring exceptional management for profitability.

**Why It Matters:** This illustrates Berkshire's ideal acquisition profile: family businesses with multi-generational management, exceptional capital discipline, and alignment of manager and owner interests. The H.H. Brown compensation system represents one of the best incentive structures Buffett has encountered.

## **Insight 8: The Fannie Mae Mistake—$1.4 Billion Cost of Indecision**

**Key Message:** Failing to complete a $350-400 million Fannie Mae purchase due to indecision about rising stock prices cost Berkshire approximately $1.4 billion in foregone gains.

**Details:** In early 1988, Berkshire decided to buy 30 million shares (post-split adjusted) of Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae). The company was understandable, management excellent (David Maxwell had proven himself), and Buffett confirmed Maxwell's comfort with a large position. After purchasing 7 million shares, the stock price began climbing and Buffett stopped buying out of frustration—a mistake he "thankfully" didn't repeat with Coca-Cola. Worse, he sold the 7 million shares held, claiming distaste for small positions. By year-end 1991, this mistake cost approximately $1.4 billion in foregone gains. Buffett confesses: "I wish I could give you a halfway rational explanation for my amateurish behavior vis-a-vis Fannie Mae. But there isn't one." This example falls into the "mistakes of omission" category—not buying when circumstances were favorable, rather than actively making bad purchases.

**Why It Matters:** This demonstrates that even exceptional investors make emotional decisions contradicting their stated principles. The irony: Buffett successfully resisted the same temptation with Coca-Cola, continuing to buy despite rising prices. The Fannie Mae mistake illustrates how inconsistent application of sound principles can be extraordinarily costly.

## **Insight 9: Super-Catastrophe Insurance Volatility—Accounting Chaos in Concentrated Risk**

**Key Message:** Berkshire's super-cat insurance business creates accounting inconsistency, with expected $100 million annual profits swinging between $100 million gain and $200 million loss depending on catastrophe occurrence.

**Details:** Berkshire writes roughly $100 million annual premiums for super-cat reinsurance (protection for reinsurers against major hurricanes, earthquakes, windstorms). The business structure: reinsurers buy policies protecting against industry-wide losses exceeding specified thresholds. Expected payout ratio: 90% of premiums over the long term. In any given year: either ~$100 million profit (catastrophe-free year) or ~$200 million loss (major catastrophe year). Combined ratios swing between near-zero and 300%—never in the industry-normal 100-120% range.

The accounting problem: GAAP prohibits setting up reserves in profitable years for losses certain to occur in other years. One-year accounting cycles are "ill-suited to the nature of this business." In 1991, one super-cat event triggered payments on only 25% of policies; Berkshire estimated $11 million underwriting profit. The year's biggest catastrophe was neither the Oakland fire nor Hurricane Bob, but a September typhoon in Japan causing $4-5 billion insured loss. Buffett notes that insurers will always need catastrophe reinsurance, but innocents periodically re-enter the market after catastrophe-scarce periods, driving prices to "silly levels" until they're burned. As long as rates appear adequate, Berkshire will be a major participant, leveraging its "premier financial strength" competitive advantage.

**Why It Matters:** This illustrates how concentrated risk businesses create earnings volatility that GAAP accounting cannot properly capture. Investors must understand that reported annual results may be misleading for businesses with long-tail, catastrophe-exposed characteristics.

## Executive Summary

Berkshire Hathaway's 1991 letter addresses a fundamental inflection point: the company has grown so large that even extraordinary capital deployment opportunities cannot sustain historical growth rates. With $7.4 billion in capital, requiring $370 million in annual profits to achieve one percentage point of return improvement, the mathematics of scale become increasingly constraining.

The 39.6% 1991 return resulted from a temporary "double-dip" benefit—both earnings growth and P/E multiple expansion on Coca-Cola and Gillette. This double-dip cannot repeat annually; future returns must come from business value creation alone. This reality is reinforced by look-through earnings declining 14% despite reported operating earnings remaining respectable, revealing challenges in investee company performance.

The media industry analysis represents Buffett's most comprehensive examination of business model transformation. Media properties have shifted from economic franchises (sustainable pricing power, manageable without operational excellence) to vulnerable businesses (dependent on cost position or supply tightness). This structural shift permanently reduces intrinsic value by 50-60% at similar earnings levels, demonstrating how industry dynamics can override management quality.

See's Candies' twenty-year retrospective exemplifies the power of economic franchises: $410 million in profits distributed to Berkshire with just $18 million reinvested capital beyond the original $7 million base. This demonstrates how exceptional managers within strong franchises deliver extraordinary returns without capital intensity.

The H.H. Brown acquisition illustrates Berkshire's dealmaking philosophy: family businesses with multi-generational management, strong balance sheets, and incentive alignment. The company's unusual compensation system (managers receiving salary plus profit percentage after capital charges) represents one of the best incentive structures Buffett has encountered.

The Fannie Mae mistake confession is particularly valuable: a $1.4 billion cost resulting from indecision about rising stock prices—violating Buffett's own stated principle of continuing to buy quality at rising prices. This "mistake of omission" demonstrates how even exceptional investors make emotionally-driven decisions contradicting their principles.

The super-catastrophe insurance section reveals how accounting conventions fail to capture business reality. Earnings swinging between $100 million profits and $200 million losses cannot be understood through annual combined ratios; instead, investors must appreciate the long-term expected economics and accounting distortions.

For investors, the key lessons are: (1) understand that capital base growth inevitably constrains return rates; (2) distinguish between sustainable value creation and temporary valuation expansion; (3) recognize that structural industry changes can permanently reduce business values; (4) appreciate the power of economic franchises requiring minimal reinvestment; (5) seek manager alignment through unusual compensation structures; (6) acknowledge that emotional decision-making can override sound principles, often with enormous costs; and (7) understand that accounting conventions may distort economic reality in concentrated risk businesses.
