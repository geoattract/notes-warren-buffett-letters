# Berkshire Hathaway 1989 Shareholder Letter: 9 Key Insights

## **Insight 1: The Inevitable Slowdown—From "Bacteria" to "Anchors"**

**Key Message:** As Berkshire's capital base grows exponentially, maintaining high percentage returns becomes mathematically impossible, requiring acknowledgment of structural constraints on future performance.

**Details:** Buffett opens with a Carl Sagan metaphor about bacteria that double every 15 minutes, eventually outweighing the sun. He applies this to Berkshire: "From Berkshire's present base of $4.9 billion in net worth, we will find it much more difficult to average 15% annual growth in book value than we did to average 23.8% from the $22 million we began with." The mathematical reality is unavoidable—as the base grows, percentage growth must decelerate. Buffett explicitly rejects the notion that Berkshire can continue at historical rates: "High growth rates must self-destruct" in a finite world. This isn't management failure; it's mathematical law. The company achieved 23.8% annual growth from a $22 million base, but from $4.9 billion, even 15% growth requires generating enormous absolute dollars of value.

**Why It Matters:** This demonstrates intellectual honesty that's rare among CEOs. Rather than projecting continued high returns, Buffett acknowledges that scale inevitably constrains future growth. For shareholders, this tempering of expectations should moderate return assumptions and reduce the risk of disappointment when growth inevitably slows.

## **Insight 2: The "Catch-Up" Bonus Is Over—Understanding the Double-Dip Advantage**

**Key Message:** Berkshire's past extraordinary returns benefited from a "double-dip": actual business value creation plus market revaluation as investors recognized these businesses were underpriced. The second dip is now exhausted.

**Details:** Buffett explains that Berkshire's performance had two components: (1) exceptional gains in intrinsic business value from excellent operating businesses, and (2) additional returns from market "correction" as stock prices rose relative to business value. When assets like Capital Cities, GEICO, and Washington Post were underpriced, both components pushed returns higher. Now that "the virtues of these businesses have been widely recognized" and prices are "full," the catch-up bonus has evaporated. The company will continue to benefit from good business value creation, but "our catch-up rewards have been realized, which means we'll have to settle for a single-dip in the future." This is critical: past returns included a one-time revaluation that won't repeat.

**Why It Matters:** This explains why historical returns may be misleading for projecting future returns. A significant portion of Berkshire's exceptional past performance came from the market repricing undervalued assets—a dynamic that cannot repeat indefinitely for the same investments.

## **Insight 3: The Deferred Tax "Loan" from the U.S. Treasury**

**Key Message:** Berkshire's $1.1 billion deferred tax liability on unrealized gains functions as an interest-free loan from the U.S. Treasury, available only if the company elects to sell appreciated securities.

**Details:** Buffett provides sophisticated analysis of deferred tax liabilities, which accountants record as equivalent to $1.1 billion in debt despite being fundamentally different from a trade creditor obligation due in 15 days. He reframes the deferred tax as "an interest-free loan from the U.S. Treasury that comes due only at our election." This loan has peculiar characteristics: it's available only to finance ownership of the specific appreciated stocks, fluctuates daily with market prices, and can be triggered only if Berkshire chooses to sell securities. The "Rip Van Winkle style of investing" thus has a mathematical advantage: by holding securities indefinitely and deferring tax realization, the company gains the use of government funds at zero interest cost. Buffett illustrates this with an extreme example: doubling a $1 investment annually and selling each year (triggering 34% tax) produces $25,250 after 20 years, while a single investment that doubles 20 times produces $692,000 after the same tax—a 27:1 difference driven entirely by tax timing.

**Why It Matters:** This reveals a powerful but often-overlooked advantage of long-term investing: the time value of deferred taxes. The government essentially finances Berkshire's holdings at zero interest, provided the company remains patient. This mathematical advantage compounds over decades and explains part of Berkshire's superior returns.

## **Insight 4: "Look-Through" Earnings—The Unreported Value Creation**

**Key Message:** Berkshire's true earning power exceeds reported operating earnings by roughly $212 million annually—the retained earnings of major investees that standard accounting prohibits reporting.

**Details:** Berkshire received only $45 million in dividends from its five major investees (Capital Cities, GEICO, Washington Post, Coca-Cola, Salomon) but its share of retained earnings totaled approximately $212 million. If these retained earnings had been distributed, reported operating earnings would have approached $500 million rather than $300 million. Buffett argues these undistributed earnings are "as valuable to us as those we report—and even think they may be more valuable." The reason: these investees employ capital under talented, owner-oriented managers who may deploy capital better than Berkshire could in its own businesses. This introduces the "look-through" approach: appending the company's share of operating earnings retained by investees to its own reported earnings, excluding capital gains. For intrinsic value to grow at 15% annually, look-through earnings must grow at similar rates.

**Why It Matters:** This highlights a critical gap between reported and economic earnings. Investors focusing solely on Berkshire's reported operating earnings would significantly underestimate the company's true earning power. This also demonstrates the value of owning stakes in exceptional businesses run by owner-oriented managers—they effectively redeploy capital for Berkshire without requiring approval or involvement.

## **Insight 5: The "Sainted Seven Plus One"—Operating Businesses Achieving 57% ROE**

**Key Message:** Berkshire's eight operating businesses (Borsheim's, Buffalo News, Fechheimer, Kirby, Nebraska Furniture Mart, Scott Fetzer Manufacturing, See's, and World Book) generated 57% after-tax returns on average equity capital with zero net leverage.

**Details:** These businesses—which Buffett creatively renames "The Sainted Seven Plus One" after the Borsheim's acquisition—represent an exceptional collection of economic franchises run by exceptional managers. Their combined financial statements show 57% returns on average equity capital achieved with no net leverage (cash equivalents matching funded debt). Buffett compares these managers to the 1927 New York Yankees lineup: "When I call off the names of our managers—the Blumkin, Friedman and Heldman families, Chuck Huggins, Stan Lipsey, and Ralph Schey—I feel the same glow that Miller Huggins must have experienced when he announced the lineup of his 1927 New York Yankees." The Borsheim's acquisition exemplifies Berkshire's dealmaking: Ike Friedman manages the jewelry business with the same philosophy as Mrs. B at Nebraska Furniture Mart—"Sell cheap and tell the truth"—enabling exceptional volume and low expenses.

**Why It Matters:** These businesses demonstrate that exceptional returns on capital result from combining strong economic franchises with exceptional management. The diversity of these businesses (jewelry, furniture, news, candy, books, uniforms, manufacturing) proves that high returns aren't limited to specific industries but rather flow from management quality and business model excellence.

## **Insight 6: Insurance Capacity Is Determined by Managerial Psychology, Not Regulators**

**Key Message:** Insurance industry capacity—and therefore profitability—depends primarily on the mental state of insurance managers, not on regulatory constraints or financial ratios.

**Details:** Buffett explains that while insurance regulators attempt to limit writing capacity to some multiple of net worth (X dollars of business per Y dollars of equity), these constraints have proven ineffective. "Regulators, insurance brokers, and customers are all slow to discipline companies that strain their resources. They also acquiesce when companies grossly overstate their true capital." Therefore, "the amount of industry capacity at any particular moment primarily depends on the mental state of insurance managers." Good profits occur only when capacity is in shortage, which happens only "when insurers are frightened. That happens rarely—and most assuredly is not happening now." The combined ratio deteriorated from 104.6 in 1987 to 110.4 in 1989 (estimated), signaling underwriting losses will continue mounting. The industry needs 10% annual premium growth just to maintain profitability, yet growth has slowed to 2.1% estimated for 1989.

**Why It Matters:** This reveals the futility of hoping regulatory reforms will fix insurance industry profitability. The core problem is psychological—managers competing in a commodity business will underwrite at unfavorable prices when they fear losing volume. No regulator can fix this without becoming the de facto price-setter.

## **Insight 7: Catastrophe Coverage as a Stabilizing Force—The $250 Million Commitment**

**Key Message:** Berkshire's willingness to write $250 million of catastrophe coverage in 1989 demonstrates how exceptional capital strength enables differentiated strategy: absorbing risks others must lay off.

**Details:** After Hurricane Hugo and the California earthquake decimated catastrophe reinsurance providers in 1989, Berkshire offered to write up to $250 million of catastrophe coverage without laying off risk to other reinsurers. This sets Berkshire apart: most reinsurers write large CAT coverage only because they can immediately retrocede (resell) most of the risk. Berkshire retains its entire commitment. This ability rests on two factors: (1) $6 billion of net worth in insurance subsidiaries (second-highest in the U.S.), and (2) philosophical indifference to quarterly earnings volatility. "We will accept more reinsurance risk for our own account than any other company" because "we simply don't care what earnings we report quarterly, or even annually, just as long as the decisions leading to those earnings were reached intelligently." This posture is "one few insurance managements will assume"—most fear a large single-quarter loss more than they fear long-term mediocre returns.

**Why It Matters:** This illustrates how structural advantages (massive capital, patient shareholders) enable strategic positioning that competitors cannot match. By being willing to absorb risks that frighten others, Berkshire becomes a stabilizing force during crises—paradoxically adding stability to an otherwise chaotic market.

## **Insight 8: The Coca-Cola Investment—A 52-Year Delay**

**Key Message:** Buffett's $1 billion investment in Coca-Cola in 1989 represents a humbling acknowledgment that he took 52 years to recognize an obvious franchise, and this delay cost Berkshire shareholders billions.

**Details:** Buffett admits that he first consumed Coca-Cola in 1935-1936 and even profited by reselling Cokes from his family grocery store at 5 cents each (purchased for 25 cents per six-pack). For the next 52 years, he "carefully avoided buying even a single share, instead allocating major portions of my net worth to street railway companies, windmill manufacturers, anthracite producers, textile businesses, trading-stamp issuers, and the like." Only in summer 1988 did he recognize what he should have seen decades earlier: that Roberto Goizueta's leadership (beginning in 1981) had transformed Coca-Cola into a global juggernaut with exceptional management combining perfect "mesh of marketing and finance." Buffett notes: "If I had been thinking straight I would have persuaded my grandfather to sell the grocery store back in 1936 and put all of the proceeds into Coca-Cola stock. I've learned my lesson: My response time to the next glaringly attractive idea will be slashed to well under 50 years."

**Why It Matters:** This demonstrates intellectual humility and acknowledges the cost of missed obvious opportunities. It also reveals that even exceptional investors are subject to pattern-recognition failures and can miss obvious investment opportunities hiding in plain sight for decades.

## **Insight 9: The Zero-Coupon Bond Disaster—Financial Engineering Gone Wrong**

**Key Message:** While Berkshire issued zero-coupon convertible bonds responsibly, the broader use of zero-coupon and pay-in-kind bonds by junk-rated companies exemplifies financial chicanery that delays recognition of failure and deceives investors.

**Details:** Buffett launches a scathing critique of zero-coupon and PIK bond issuance by weak credits, distinguishing Berkshire's responsible $902.6 million issuance from the financial manipulation endemic in leveraged buyout financing. He explains the progression of financial engineering during the LBO boom: (1) initially, debt was sized to free cash flow; (2) then, free cash flow was allocated entirely to interest payments with no debt reduction; (3) then, EBITDA became the measurement (ignoring depreciation as "not real expense"); (4) finally, cash interest only (not accrued interest) was measured against EBITDA, allowing massive zero-coupon and PIK issuance to be hidden from the calculation. The result: companies earning $100 million annually could take on $60 million of annual accrued interest beyond $90 million of cash interest, with total obligations doubling annually through compounding. Buffett invokes Galbraith's concept of "the bezzle" (undiscovered embezzlement)—with zeros, one party experiences "income" without the other experiencing the pain of expenditure, creating phantom wealth as long as investors "willingly don their Peter Pan wings and repeatedly say 'I believe.'"

**Why It Matters:** This section reveals how financial engineering can distort reality and delay recognition of fundamental business problems. The zero-coupon bond mania of the late 1980s allowed promoters to finance deals at any price, knowing that failure could be deferred years into the future while fees accumulated. This critique extends to investment bankers, whom Buffett argues should act as gatekeepers but instead compete to finance increasingly marginal deals.

## **Insight 10: Mistakes of the First 25 Years—The "Cigar Butt" Approach**

**Key Message:** Buffett's single biggest investment mistake was adopting the "cigar butt" approach—buying cheap, mediocre businesses hoping for a quick profit rather than excellent businesses at fair prices.

**Details:** Buffett identifies purchasing control of Berkshire itself as his "first mistake." Though he recognized the textile business as unpromising, he bought it because the price was cheap, hoping for "some hiccup in the fortunes of the business" that would enable profitable exit. He calls this the "cigar butt" approach: a used cigar discarded on the street might have one puff left, making it profitable despite low quality. The flaw: (1) the "bargain" price rarely proves to be the bargain it appears, and (2) advantage erodes quickly as the low-return business underperforms. His Baltimore department store acquisition (Hochschild Kohn) reinforced this lesson—bought at substantial discount from book value with first-class management and hidden asset values, it proved unprofitable because the underlying business was mediocre. Buffett notes: "It's far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price." Three related lessons follow: (1) good managers cannot fix bad businesses ("good jockeys will do well on good horses, but not on broken-down nags"); (2) it's better to avoid difficult business problems than solve them ("in both business and investments it is usually far more profitable to simply stick with the easy and obvious"); and (3) the "institutional imperative" causes businesses to waste capital on projects merely because funds are available, resist any change in direction, and mindlessly imitate competitor behavior.

**Why It Matters:** This self-critique reveals how Buffett's investment philosophy evolved from bargain hunting to quality focus. The lesson—that time is "the friend of the wonderful business, the enemy of the mediocre"—explains much of Berkshire's success in subsequent decades by concentrating on exceptional businesses rather than cheap ones.

## Executive Summary

Berkshire Hathaway's 1989 letter is a masterclass in intellectual honesty and financial sophistication, marking a significant inflection point in the company's development. At $4.9 billion in net worth and 44.4% annual gains, Berkshire has achieved extraordinary success—yet Buffett spends considerable effort tempering expectations for the future by acknowledging fundamental constraints.

The "bacteria metaphor" opening immediately establishes the core theme: scale inevitably constrains percentage returns. Moving from a $22 million base where 23.8% annual growth was achievable to a $4.9 billion base where even 15% growth is ambitious, Buffett demonstrates that mathematical law limits future returns. This is refreshingly honest compared to most executives' optimistic projections.

The "double-dip" analysis reveals that Berkshire's past returns included a one-time revaluation bonus as the market recognized the quality of holdings like Coca-Cola and GEICO. This catch-up bonus is exhausted, meaning future returns will depend solely on underlying business value creation. The deferred tax section then explains one underappreciated advantage of long-term investing: the interest-free "loan" from the U.S. Treasury that finances holdings indefinitely, provided the company remains patient.

The "look-through earnings" framework introduces a critical insight: Berkshire's true economic earning power exceeds reported earnings by roughly 40% when accounting for retained earnings of investees. This demonstrates how owning stakes in exceptional businesses run by owner-oriented managers creates value without requiring operational involvement.

The operating businesses section celebrates the "Sainted Seven Plus One"—eight businesses achieving 57% returns on equity with zero leverage. These businesses prove that exceptional returns flow from combining strong economic franchises with exceptional management. The diversity of these businesses (jewelry, furniture, newspapers, candy, books, uniforms, manufacturing) demonstrates that high returns aren't industry-specific.

The insurance analysis provides a sobering assessment: industry capacity depends on managerial psychology, not regulatory constraints, meaning industry profitability will remain mediocre until fear forces prices higher. Yet Berkshire's $250 million catastrophe commitment demonstrates how exceptional capital strength enables differentiated strategy—absorbing risks competitors must lay off during crises.

The Coca-Cola investment admission stands as perhaps the most humbling moment in the letter. After observing Coke's franchise for 52 years and even profiting from reselling the product as a boy, Buffett took until 1988 to recognize the obvious investment opportunity. This costly delay illustrates that even exceptional investors are subject to pattern-recognition failures.

The zero-coupon bond critique exposes how financial engineering can distort reality and defer recognition of problems while fees accumulate. Buffett's frustration with investment bankers who abandoned gatekeeping roles in favor of deal volume reflects concern about systemic instability.

Finally, the "mistakes" section provides invaluable investment philosophy: the "cigar butt" approach fails because time is "the friend of the wonderful business, the enemy of the mediocre." The institutional imperative causes businesses to waste capital on acquisition and expansion merely because funds are available. And the most costly mistakes were opportunities missed—stocks and businesses Buffett understood but lacked conviction to buy.

For investors, the key lessons are: (1) acknowledge that scale inevitably constrains future returns; (2) distinguish between catch-up revaluation bonuses and sustainable business value creation; (3) understand the time-value advantage of deferred taxes; (4) recognize the true earning power of businesses through "look-through" analysis; (5) appreciate how exceptional capital strength enables differentiated strategies during crises; (6) maintain intellectual humility about obvious opportunities; and (7) prioritize time ownership quality over price bargains. These principles explain Berkshire's sustained success while providing realistic expectations for future returns.
