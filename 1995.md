# Berkshire Hathaway 1995 Shareholder Letter Analysis

## Nine Major Valuable Insights for Investors

---

### **Point 1: Size as a Persistent Drag on Returns—The Mathematical Reality**

**Key Message:** As Berkshire's capital grew from $22 million to nearly $12 billion, the investment universe available shrank dramatically; the company now requires $100 million+ minimum investments, making future growth inevitably slower.

**Details:** Buffett states bluntly: "We proceed with two advantages: First, our operating managers are outstanding...Second, Charlie and I have had considerable experience in allocating capital. The giant disadvantage we face is size: In the early years, we needed only good ideas, but now we need good big ideas." Over 30 years, per-share book value grew at 23.6% compounded annually (from $19 to $14,426), but 1995's 43.1% gain came in "a year in which any fool could make a bundle in the stock market...a rising tide lifts all yachts." The data table shows marketable securities per share exploded from $4 in 1965 to $22,088 in 1995 (33.4% annual growth), while pre-tax operating earnings per share grew only 14.7% annually. Buffett commits to staying disciplined using Ted Williams' analogy: "To be a good hitter, you've got to get a good ball to hit...If I have to bite at stuff that is out of my happy zone, I'm not a .344 hitter."

**Why It Matters:** For large institutional investors and portfolio managers, this insight explains why mega-cap returns must eventually moderate regardless of management quality. It validates concentration strategies for smaller investors who don't face size constraints and teaches that exceptional past returns provide no assurance about future performance.

### **Point 2: The Acquisition Advantage of "Walking Around"—Successful Deal-Making Without Strategic Plans**

**Key Message:** Berkshire's three major 1995 acquisitions (Helzberg's, R.C. Willey, GEICO) succeeded because the company lacks strategic plans, allowing decisions based purely on intrinsic value rather than forcing capital into predetermined directions.

**Details:** Buffett describes "ABWA" (acquisitions by walking around): Helzberg's came from a chance encounter at 58th and Fifth Avenue in NYC when Barnett Helzberg Jr., a shareholder, approached Buffett after the Annual Meeting. R.C. Willey came via Irv Blumkin (Nebraska Furniture Mart's owner) mentioning it to Bill Child, R.C. Willey's CEO. These three acquisitions roughly doubled Berkshire's revenues yet "neither materially increased our shares outstanding nor our debt...our headquarters staff grew only from 11 to 12." Buffett emphasizes the advantage of having "no strategic plan": "Thus we feel no need to proceed in an ordained direction (a course leading almost invariably to silly purchase prices) but can instead simply decide what makes sense for our owners." He contrasts this with most acquisition-minded managers: "In making acquisitions, we always mentally compare any move we are contemplating with dozens of other opportunities open to us, including the purchase of small pieces of the best businesses in the world via the stock market."

**Why It Matters:** For entrepreneurs selling businesses, this demonstrates why Berkshire can offer advantages other buyers cannot: tax-free stock transactions, management autonomy, permanence of ownership, and cultural fit matter as much as price. For investors, this reveals that disciplined capital allocators without ego-driven expansion plans outperform deal-happy managers over decades.

### **Point 3: GEICO—45-Year Relationship and the Power of Sustainable Competitive Advantages**

**Key Message:** Berkshire's complete acquisition of GEICO for $2.3 billion represents validation of a 45-year thesis: low-cost direct distribution creates an "unbreachable moat" that competitors cannot replicate regardless of capital deployed.

**Details:** Buffett traces the relationship to 1951 when, as a Columbia student of Ben Graham, he traveled to GEICO's Washington headquarters on a Saturday and met Lorimer Davidson, who spent four hours teaching him about the insurance industry. "No one has ever received a better half-day course in how the insurance industry functions nor in the factors that enable one company to excel over others...After my session with Davy, I was more excited about GEICO than I have ever been about a stock." Young Buffett accumulated 350 shares at $10,282 (65% of his net worth at yearend 1951), sold them in 1952 for $15,259 to buy Western Insurance, then watched those GEICO shares grow to $1.3 million over 20 years—a lesson about "the inadvisability of selling a stake in an identifiably-wonderful company." By 1995, GEICO (which faced near-bankruptcy in the early 1970s but was rescued by CEO Jack Byrne in 1976) had become the seventh-largest auto insurer with 3.7 million cars insured. Tony Nicely and Lou Simpson, GEICO's exceptional managers, had driven "underwriting and loss adjustment expenses down further to 23.6% of premiums, nearly one percentage point below 1994's ratio...Thanks to Tony and his management team, GEICO's moat widened in 1995."

**Why It Matters:** For investors evaluating long-term holdings, this case demonstrates that competitive advantages (cost structures, distribution efficiencies, brand loyalty) matter far more than market share or size. It shows that relationships built over decades on mutual respect and aligned interests create acquisition opportunities unavailable to arm's-length buyers. It validates patience in capital deployment, as the original GEICO investment took 45 years to fully mature.

### **Point 4: The Retailing Paradox—"Have-to-Be-Smart-Once" vs. "Have-to-Be-Smart-Every-Day" Businesses**

**Key Message:** Helzberg's and R.C. Willey represent "have-to-be-smart-every-day" retailing businesses, which are inherently risky but rewarding when paired with exceptional management that loves competition.

**Details:** Buffett contrasts retailing with other industries: "In contrast to this have-to-be-smart-every-day business, there is what I call the have-to-be-smart-once business. For example, if you were smart enough to buy a network TV station very early in the game, you could put in a shiftless and backward nephew to run things, and the business would still do well for decades." In retailing, "your competitor is always copying and then topping whatever you do...In retailing, to coast is to fail." R.C. Willey exemplifies this: Bill Child took over from his father-in-law in 1954 at $250,000 in sales and built the company to $257 million by 1995, capturing over 50% of Utah's furniture market through relentless execution. Helzberg's, started by Barnett's grandfather in 1915, grew sales from $10 million in 1974 to $282 million in 1994, with average per-store sales of $2 million "far more than competitors operating similarly-sized stores achieve." Critically, Buffett notes: "We would not have bought the business if Jeff [Comment] had not been there to run it. Buying a retailer without good management is like buying the Eiffel Tower without an elevator."

**Why It Matters:** For investors evaluating retailers, this framework reveals why retail businesses are shooting stars—appearing brilliant until competitive dynamics catch up. It teaches that retail success requires not just initial strategy but continuous innovation and adaptation. It explains why Berkshire insists on proven, dedicated management in such businesses and why management quality is worth premium valuations in inherently difficult industries.

### **Point 5: Insurance Float at Negative Cost—The Mathematical Engine of Berkshire's Success**

**Key Message:** Berkshire's insurance float grew from $17.3 million in 1967 to $3.6 billion in 1995 at compound annual growth of 20.7%, with cost of float negative in many years—essentially free leverage that has "boosted Berkshire's performance in a major way."

**Details:** The insurance float table reveals Berkshire obtained float "at very advantageous terms" for 28 years. Float grew from $17.3M in 1967 to $3.6B in 1995, while the cost of float averaged below government bond yields in most years. Buffett explains the mechanism: "Since our float has cost us virtually nothing over the years, it has in effect served as equity...Let's assume that instead of our having $3.4 billion of float at the end of 1994, we had replaced it with $3.4 billion of equity. We would have owned no more assets than we did during 1995. We would, however, have had somewhat lower earnings because the cost of float was negative last year." The addition of GEICO immediately increased float by nearly $3 billion more. Critically, however, Buffett cautions: "We had our third straight year of good fortune in the super-cat business...Since truly major catastrophes occur infrequently, our super-cat business can be expected to show large profits in most years but occasionally to record a huge loss." Ajit Jain, GEICO's reinsurance genius, wrote unusual policies: insurance on Mike Tyson's life (declining to zero over years), Lloyd's against 225+ names dying in one year, and launch/first-year orbit insurance for two Chinese satellites.

**Why It Matters:** For insurance investors and analysts, this demonstrates how low-cost float becomes a permanent competitive advantage, allowing exceptional asset deployment. It teaches that superior long-term returns depend on liability structure (cheap float) as much as asset returns. It reveals that Berkshire's insurance business is not merely a source of underwriting profits but a source of permanent, growing capital deployed at the parent's discretion.

### **Point 6: The Gillette Preferred Mistake—Missing a $625 Million Opportunity Through Excessive Cleverness**

**Key Message:** Buffett's decision to buy Gillette convertible preferred stock rather than common shares created a $625 million lost opportunity by prioritizing short-term dividend income over long-term compounding.

**Details:** In 1989, Buffett purchased $600 million of Gillette preferred convertible into 48 million common shares. He acknowledges: "Taking an alternative route with the $600 million, I probably could have purchased 60 million shares of common from the company...given that this would have been a huge private placement carrying important restrictions, I probably could have bought the stock at a discount of at least 5%." Instead, he was "far too clever" to negotiate for common stock. The preferred paid extra dividend income for less than two years before the company called the issue (exercising its right to redeem). "If I had negotiated for common rather than preferred, we would have been better off at yearend 1995 by $625 million, minus the 'excess' dividends of about $70 million." This $555 million after-tax opportunity cost represents one of Buffett's most explicit acknowledgments of analytical error. The irony: Gillette proved to be Berkshire's best performer among all preferred purchases, yet this superior performance came despite—not because of—the preferred structure.

**Why It Matters:** For investors, this transparency about decision-making errors teaches intellectual humility. It reveals that even exceptional investors can optimize for the wrong metric (short-term income rather than total return) when dealing with complex securities. It validates the principle that simple equity stakes usually outperform hybrid securities in high-quality businesses.

### **Point 7: The Class B Stock Recapitalization—Combating "Clones" While Maintaining Shareholder Quality**

**Key Message:** Berkshire created Class B shares trading at 1/30th of Class A to prevent expensive unit trusts from being marketed to unsophisticated investors while keeping existing shareholders knowledgeable and long-term focused.

**Details:** The recapitalization created Class B shares with 1/30th the economic rights of Class A (but 1/200th the voting power and no access to the charitable contributions program). Each Class A share converts optionally to 30 Class B shares, but not vice versa. Buffett explains the rationale: "The unit trusts that have recently surfaced fly in the face of these goals. They would be sold by brokers working for big commissions, would impose other burdensome costs on their shareholders, and would be marketed en masse to unsophisticated buyers, apt to be seduced by our past record...The sure outcome: a multitude of investors destined to be disappointed." By creating a low-price Class B share listed on the NYSE, Berkshire made expensive clone trusts unmerchandisable. Buffett emphasizes: "Though the per-share intrinsic value of our stock has grown at an excellent rate during the past five years, its market price has grown still faster...That kind of market overperformance cannot persist indefinitely...What we would prefer instead is to have the market price of Berkshire precisely track its intrinsic value...We will come closer to this goal if our present and prospective shareholders are informed, business-oriented and not exposed to high-commission salesmanship."

**Why It Matters:** For shareholders of public companies, this demonstrates how founder/long-term management can structure capital to discourage short-term speculators and expensive intermediaries while serving legitimate shareholder needs. It reveals tensions between making investments accessible and maintaining culture and shareholder quality. It validates the principle that low-cost access (Class B at 1/30th price) beats high-cost alternatives aggressively marketed.

### **Point 8: Disney/Cap Cities Merger—The Value of Serendipity and Aligned Management**

**Key Message:** A chance encounter on Wildflower Lane in Sun Valley between Buffett, Michael Eisner, and Tom Murphy catalyzed the Disney/Cap Cities merger, demonstrating how aligned, rational managers can overcome historic obstacles through informal dialogue.

**Details:** On July 14, 1995, at 1:15 p.m., Buffett was leaving Herbert Allen's home to meet Tom Murphy for golf when he encountered Michael Eisner, who had just delivered a presentation on Disney. Buffett congratulated him, the three discussed a possible merger (discussed before but never concluded), and "Within a few weeks, they both did [bend on stock/cash terms], at which point a contract was put together in three very busy days." The deal "makes so much sense that I'm sure it would have occurred without that chance encounter...But when I ran into Michael that day on Wildflower Lane, he was heading for his plane, so without that accidental meeting the deal certainly wouldn't have happened in the time frame it did." Buffett celebrates Tom Murphy: "To put it simply, he is as fine an executive as I have ever seen...When I say that I like to be associated with managers whom I would love to have as a sibling, in-law, or trustee of my will, Murph is the exemplar of what I mean." Yet Buffett also reveals his own error: "Don't later be as dumb as I was two years ago when I sold one-third of our holdings in Cap Cities for $635 million (versus the $1.27 billion those shares would bring in the Disney merger)."

**Why It Matters:** For corporate strategists, this demonstrates how informal networks and relationships enable major transactions that formal processes might not. It reveals that serendipity plays a role in business outcomes even for disciplined managers. For investors, it shows the value of managers with both excellence and humility—Murph's willingness to flex on deal structure enabled Berkshire's participation.

### **Point 9: "Have-to-Be-Smart-Once" vs. Continuous Competition—Business Model Selection**

**Key Message:** Network TV stations represent "have-to-be-smart-once" businesses where initial strategic positioning creates decades of returns; retailing requires constant innovation or face bankruptcy despite quality management.

**Details:** Buffett contrasts television stations with retailing: "For example, if you were smart enough to buy a network TV station very early in the game, you could put in a shiftless and backward nephew to run things, and the business would still do well for decades. You'd do far better, of course, if you put in Tom Murphy, but you could stay comfortably in the black without him. For a retailer, hiring that nephew would be an express ticket to bankruptcy." This framework explains Berkshire's different approaches: Capital Cities/ABC (acquired and held for its sustainable competitive advantages) generated exceptional returns even during management transitions, while Helzberg's and R.C. Willey required Berkshire to retain the founding/incumbent management specifically because retailing rewards only continuous excellence. Buffett emphasizes: "The two retailing businesses we purchased this year are blessed with terrific managers who love to compete and have done so successfully for decades...We want them to feel that the businesses they run are theirs. This means no second-guessing by Charlie and me."

**Why It Matters:** For business evaluators and acquirers, this framework provides a powerful tool for assessing whether a business can survive mediocre management (suggesting structural durability) or requires continuous excellence (suggesting fragility despite current performance). It explains why Berkshire tolerates complete autonomy in some businesses but insists on retaining exceptional managers in others.

## Executive Summary

Warren Buffett's 1995 shareholder letter celebrates exceptional success while confronting an uncomfortable paradox: Berkshire's net worth grew 45% ($5.3 billion), per-share book value rose 43.1%, yet Buffett cautions that "there's no reason to do handsprings over 1995's gains...a rising tide lifts all yachts." The letter's wisdom begins with accepting that Berkshire's size—now $12 billion in capital—inevitably constrains future returns. The company now requires $100+ million investments, shrinking an already-limited universe of suitable acquisitions. Buffett's admission ("we need good big ideas") frames the central tension: exceptional returns require exceptional capital discipline precisely when capital is abundant.

The centerpiece is three transformative acquisitions executed through "ABWA" (acquisitions by walking around): Helzberg's Diamond Shops, R.C. Willey Home Furnishings, and GEICO Corporation. Remarkably, these doubled Berkshire's revenue without materially increasing shares outstanding or debt, and headquarters staff grew only from 11 to 12 people. Each acquisition succeeded because Berkshire lacks strategic plans requiring predetermined directions; decisions flowed purely from intrinsic value analysis. The GEICO acquisition—completing a 45-year relationship dating to Buffett's 1951 Saturday visit—validated the thesis that sustainable competitive advantages (direct marketing's cost advantages) create unbreachable moats that competitors cannot replicate. Tony Nicely and Lou Simpson, GEICO's exceptional managers, demonstrated that excellence in low-cost operations widens the moat further.

A crucial insight distinguishes "have-to-be-smart-once" businesses (network TV stations, insurance franchises) from "have-to-be-smart-every-day" retailing. Helzberg's and R.C. Willey exemplify the latter: Bill Child transformed R.C. Willey from $250,000 in sales (1954) to $257 million (1995) through relentless competition and daily innovation; Helzberg's achieved $2 million average per-store sales despite an intensely competitive industry. Yet unlike TV stations where mediocre management barely dents profitability, retailing bankruptcy is the reward for complacency. Berkshire's discipline: retain founding management ("Buying a retailer without good management is like buying the Eiffel Tower without an elevator") while providing complete autonomy.

Insurance float—growing at 20.7% compounded annually from $17.3 million (1967) to $3.6 billion (1995)—emerged as Berkshire's mathematical engine. Obtained at negative cost in many years (the company was paid to hold it through underwriting profits), float functioned as permanent, low-cost equity deployed by the parent company. The GEICO acquisition added $3 billion more. Yet Buffett's repeated caution about super-catastrophe business profitability reveals intellectual honesty: three consecutive years of profits mask tail risks; truly major catastrophes occur infrequently, guaranteeing eventual huge losses. This transparency contrasts sharply with corporate tendency to present exceptional profits as sustainable.

The letter's transparency extends to acknowledging analytical errors. The Gillette preferred investment—prioritizing short-term dividend income over long-term compounding—cost Berkshire approximately $625 million in foregone wealth when the company called the preferred. Even this superior performer "would have been better off" as common stock. Similarly, Buffett admits selling one-third of Cap Cities holdings two years prior for $635 million rather than holding for the Disney merger that valued those shares at $1.27 billion.

The Class B stock recapitalization addressed a strategic challenge: expensive unit trust clones were being marketed aggressively to unsophisticated investors seduced by Berkshire's past performance. By creating low-price Class B shares (trading at 1/30th of Class A with proportional economics), Berkshire made expensive clones unmerchandisable while maintaining shareholder quality. Buffett's candor—"Berkshire is selling at a price at which Charlie and I would not consider buying it"—teaches that even exceptional companies command premium valuations sometimes exceeding intrinsic value.

Finally, the Disney/Cap Cities merger illustrates how serendipitous encounters between aligned, rational managers can overcome structural obstacles. Buffett's chance meeting with Michael Eisner and Tom Murphy on Wildflower Lane catalyzed a deal discussed for years but never concluded. Buffett's celebration of Tom Murphy ("as fine an executive as I have ever seen...whom I would love to have as a sibling, in-law, or trustee of my will") reveals that capital allocation excellence ultimately depends on associating with managers whose character matches their competence. The letter's ultimate lesson: exceptional long-term wealth creation requires intellectual humility about size constraints, discipline in capital deployment, honesty about risks and mistakes, and partnerships with managers who combine excellence with human integrity—lessons applicable equally to investors managing their own portfolios.
