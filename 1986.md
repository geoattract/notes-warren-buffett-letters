# Warren Buffett's 1986 Berkshire Hathaway Shareholder Letter: 9 Key Insights

---

## **Point 1: Business Value Grew Faster Than Book Value in 1986—Unrecorded Goodwill Is Substantial**

**Key Message:** While reported book value grew 26.1% in 1986, business value—the number that truly counts for owners—likely grew even faster due to managers dramatically improving earnings on existing capital bases without requiring incremental investment.

**Details:** Buffett acknowledges the fundamental difference between book value and intrinsic business value: "In past reports I have noted that book value at most companies differs widely from intrinsic business value - the number that really counts for owners. In our own case, however, book value has served for more than a decade as a reasonable if somewhat conservative proxy for business value. That is, our business value has moderately exceeded our book value, with the ratio between the two remaining fairly steady."

However, 1986 changed this relationship: "The good news is that in 1986 our percentage gain in business value probably exceeded the book value gain. I say 'probably' because business value is a soft number: in our own case, two equally well-informed observers might make judgments more than 10% apart."

The source of this outperformance is unrecorded economic goodwill: "A large measure of our improvement in business value relative to book value reflects the outstanding performance of key managers at our major operating businesses. These managers - the Blumkins, Mike Goldberg, the Heldmans, Chuck Huggins, Stan Lipsey, and Ralph Schey - have over the years improved the earnings of their businesses dramatically while, except in the case of insurance, utilizing little additional capital. This accomplishment builds economic value, or 'Goodwill,' that does not show up in the net worth figure on our balance sheet, nor in our per-share book value."

Yet Buffett delivers disappointing news about his own capital allocation: "So much for the good news. The bad news is that my performance did not match that of our managers. While they were doing a superb job in running our businesses, I was unable to skillfully deploy much of the capital they generated."

**Why It Matters:** This insight reveals that the most valuable asset on Berkshire's balance sheet—the economic goodwill created by exceptional management—is completely invisible to balance sheet accounting. This explains why Berkshire's intrinsic value has consistently exceeded its book value and why long-term shareholders have prospered even as growth rates moderate.

## **Point 2: Capital Allocation Is the CEO's Most Important Job at Berkshire—And It Was Difficult in 1986**

**Key Message:** With earnings of 23% annually and retention of all earnings, Berkshire's capital allocation decisions have an outsized impact on future results. In 1986, with limited acquisition opportunities and uninspiring equity valuations, Buffett paid down debt and stockpiled cash—neither exciting alternatives.

**Details:** Buffett explains why capital allocation is uniquely important at Berkshire: "The second job Charlie and I must handle is the allocation of capital, which at Berkshire is a considerably more important challenge than at most companies. Three factors make that so: we earn more money than average; we retain all that we earn; and, we are fortunate to have operations that, for the most part, require little incremental capital to remain competitive and to grow."

The mathematical implications are stark: "Obviously, the future results of a business earning 23% annually and retaining it all are far more affected by today's capital allocations than are the results of a business earning 10% and distributing half of that to shareholders. If our retained earnings - and those of our major investees, GEICO and Capital Cities/ABC, Inc. - are employed in an unproductive manner, the economics of Berkshire will deteriorate very quickly."

Yet 1986 presented challenges: "Capital allocation at Berkshire was tough work in 1986. We did make one business acquisition - The Fechheimer Bros. Company, which we will discuss in a later section...But it is relatively small, utilizing only about 2% of Berkshire's net worth."

The problem was valuations: "Meanwhile, we had no new ideas in the marketable equities field, an area in which once, only a few years ago, we could readily employ large sums in outstanding businesses at very reasonable prices. So our main capital allocation moves in 1986 were to pay off debt and stockpile funds. Neither is a fate worse than death, but they do not inspire us to do handsprings either."

**Why It Matters:** This candid acknowledgment reveals the challenge facing all capital-intensive, high-return businesses as they mature. When capital generation exceeds deployment opportunities, returns inevitably suffer. Buffett's willingness to acknowledge this constraint demonstrates intellectual honesty—most CEOs would project continued exceptional returns.

## **Point 3: Managing Talented Operators Is Simple—Hiring People Bigger Than Yourself and Not Getting in Their Way**

**Key Message:** Berkshire's managerial approach involves attracting exceptional people, removing obstacles to their success, and allowing them complete autonomy. The key is hiring people larger than yourself and maintaining an organizational culture where people work because they love it.

**Details:** Buffett explains Berkshire's two primary jobs: "(1) attracting and keeping outstanding managers to run our various operations. This hasn't been all that difficult. Usually the managers came with the companies we bought, having demonstrated their talents throughout careers that spanned a wide variety of business circumstances."

His philosophy mirrors Jack Nicklaus managing a golf team: "This approach seems elementary: if my job were to manage a golf team - and if Jack Nicklaus or Arnold Palmer were willing to play for me - neither would get a lot of directives from me about how to swing."

Regarding motivation: "Some of our key managers are independently wealthy (we hope they all become so), but that poses no threat to their continued interest: they work because they love what they do and relish the thrill of outstanding performance. They unfailingly think like owners (the highest compliment we can pay a manager) and find all aspects of their business absorbing."

He credits David Ogilvy's philosophy: "If each of us hires people who are smaller than we are, we shall become a company of dwarfs. But, if each of us hires people who are bigger than we are, we shall become a company of giants."

The organizational structure is deliberately minimal: "When you have able managers of high character running businesses about which they are passionate, you can have a dozen or more reporting to you and still have time for an afternoon nap. Conversely, if you have even one person reporting to you who is deceitful, inept or uninterested, you will find yourself with more than you can handle."

**Why It Matters:** This managerial philosophy—combining minimal oversight with maximum autonomy for exceptional people—has become increasingly influential in organizational design. It recognizes that exceptional talent is rare and that controlling such talent destroys both performance and retention.

## **Point 4: The Fechheimer Acquisition Demonstrates Ideal Corporate Culture and Multi-Generational Management**

**Key Message:** Fechheimer Bros., a uniform manufacturer founded in 1842, was acquired for $55 million based on a single unsolicited letter from shareholder and CEO Bob Heldman, exemplifying how Berkshire's disciplined acquisition criteria attract opportunities.

**Details:** The acquisition story itself reveals Berkshire's approach. Buffett received a letter from Bob Heldman on January 15, 1986: "Bob wrote that he ran a company that met our tests and suggested that we get together, which we did in Omaha after their results for 1985 were compiled."

Fechheimer's history is notable: "A uniform manufacturing and distribution business, began operations in 1842. Warren Heldman, Bob's father, became involved in the business in 1941 and his sons, Bob and George (now President), along with their sons, subsequently joined the company."

The financial structure revealed both success and opportunity: "In 1981 Fechheimer was sold to a group of venture capitalists in a leveraged buy out (an LBO), with management retaining an equity interest...After the buy out, however, operations continued to be very successful. So by the start of last year debt had been paid down substantially and the value of the equity had increased dramatically."

Buffett acquired 84% for a price based on $55 million enterprise valuation: "Fechheimer is exactly the sort of business we like to buy. Its economic record is superb; its managers are talented, high-grade, and love what they do; and the Heldman family wanted to continue its financial interest in partnership with us."

Critically, multi-generational continuity was built-in: "Both Fechheimer and NFM were right for us, and we were right for them...there are three members of the next generation, Gary, Roger and Fred, to insure continuity."

Yet Buffett revealed his limited due diligence approach: "You may be amused to know that neither Charlie nor I have been to Cincinnati, headquarters for Fechheimer, to see their operation...If our success were to depend upon insights we developed through plant inspections, Berkshire would be in big trouble. Rather, in considering an acquisition, we attempt to evaluate the economic characteristics of the business - its competitive strengths and weaknesses - and the quality of the people we will be joining."

**Why It Matters:** The Fechheimer acquisition exemplifies Berkshire's acquisition discipline—finding owner-operated businesses with proven economics, strong management, and multi-generational continuity. The fact that it originated from an unsolicited shareholder letter demonstrates the power of clear communication of acquisition criteria.

## **Point 5: Insurance Industry Faces Predictable Commodity Business Dynamics—Capacity Addition Will Eventually Destroy Profitability**

**Key Message:** Insurance industry profitability depends on premium growth exceeding loss growth (approximately 10% annually); 1986's exceptional premium growth (22.6%) will inevitably trigger capacity additions that destroy margins by 1988-1989.

**Details:** Buffett provides a detailed insurance industry analysis using historical data. The pattern is consistent: "The math of the insurance business, encapsulated by the table, is not very complicated. In years when the industry's annual gain in revenues (premiums) pokes along at 4% or 5%, underwriting losses are sure to mount."

The culprit is not physical catastrophes but judicial inflation: "Today, social and judicial inflation are the major culprits; the cost of entering a courtroom has simply ballooned. Part of the jump in cost arises from skyrocketing verdicts, and part from the tendency of judges and juries to expand the coverage of insurance policies beyond that contemplated by the insurer when the policies were written."

He predicts the cycle: "In 1986, as noted, the industry's premium volume soared even faster than loss costs. Consequently, the underwriting loss of the industry fell dramatically. In last year's report we predicted this sharp improvement but also predicted that prosperity would be fleeting. Alas, this second prediction is already proving accurate."

Evidence is emerging: "The rate of gain in the industry's premium volume has slowed significantly (from an estimated 27.1% in 1986's first quarter, to 23.5% in the second, to 21.8% in the third, to 18.7% in the fourth), and we expect further slowing in 1987."

The inevitable outcome is capacity destruction: "When the profit sun begins to shine, long-established insurers shower investors with new shares in order to build capital. In addition, newly-formed insurers rush to sell shares at the advantageous prices available in the new-issue market...These moves guarantee future trouble: capacity soars, competitive juices flow, and prices fade."

His analogy is powerful: "Such calls for improved behavior have all of the efficacy of those made by a Nebraska corn grower asking his fellow growers, worldwide, to market their corn with more statemanship. What's needed is not more statesmen, but less corn. By raising large amounts of capital in the last two years, the insurance industry has, to continue our metaphor, vastly expanded its plantings of corn."

**Why It Matters:** This analysis demonstrates that commodity business profitability is cyclical and predictable—capacity will be added when conditions improve, destroying returns. Berkshire's advantage comes not from superior underwriting but from superior financial strength and discipline to maintain underwriting standards during downturns.

## **Point 6: GEICO's Competitive Moat Widening—Lou Simpson's Investment Performance Exceeds S&P 500**

**Key Message:** GEICO's rock-bottom operating costs (23.5% expense ratio vs. 35%+ for competitors) create an expanding moat. Lou Simpson's equity portfolio returns have exceeded S&P 500 by substantial margins, averaging 28.4% annually (1980-1986) vs. 16.3% for the index.

**Details:** Buffett emphasizes GEICO's fundamental competitive advantage: "The most important ingredient in GEICO's success is rock-bottom operating costs, which set the company apart from literally hundreds of competitors that offer auto insurance. The total of GEICO's underwriting expense and loss adjustment expense in 1986 was only 23.5% of premiums. Many major companies show percentages 15 points higher than that."

He describes this as an expanding moat: "The difference between GEICO's costs and those of its competitors is a kind of moat that protects a valuable and much-sought-after business castle. No one understands this moat-around-the-castle concept better than Bill Snyder, Chairman of GEICO. He continually widens the moat by driving down costs still more, thereby defending and strengthening the economic franchise."

The improvement is accelerating: "Between 1985 and 1986, GEICO's total expense ratio dropped from 24.1% to the 23.5% mentioned earlier and, under Bill's leadership, the ratio is almost certain to drop further. If it does - and if GEICO maintains its service and underwriting standards - the company's future will be brilliant indeed."

Regarding Lou Simpson's investment performance, Buffett provides detailed data:

| Year | GEICO's Equities | S&P 500 |
|------|-----------------|---------|
| 1980 | 23.7% | 32.3% |
| 1981 | 5.4% | (5.0%) |
| 1982 | 45.8% | 21.4% |
| 1983 | 36.0% | 22.4% |
| 1984 | 21.8% | 6.2% |
| 1985 | 45.8% | 31.6% |
| 1986 | 38.7% | 18.6% |

Buffett's humility is striking: "Indeed, it's a little embarrassing for me, the fellow responsible for investments at Berkshire, to chronicle Lou's performance at GEICO. Only my ownership of a controlling block of Berkshire stock makes me secure enough to give you the following figures."

Most importantly, the method is conservative: "These are not only terrific figures but, fully as important, they have been achieved in the right way. Lou has consistently invested in undervalued common stocks that, individually, were unlikely to present him with a permanent loss and that, collectively, were close to risk-free."

**Why It Matters:** GEICO demonstrates that competitive moats—in this case, cost structure—can expand over time rather than erode. Lou Simpson's investment record shows that superior returns are achievable through disciplined value investing focused on downside protection.

## **Point 7: Current Market Conditions Offer No Attractive Equity Opportunities—Euphoria Prevails**

**Key Message:** Despite record market valuations and euphoria among investors, Berkshire finds no equities meeting its tests for purchase. Buffett warns that stock prices have become "gloriously uncoupled" from business performance, a condition mathematically unsustainable.

**Details:** Buffett's assessment is stark: "Common stocks, of course, are the most fun. When conditions are right that is, when companies with good economics and good management sell well below intrinsic business value - stocks sometimes provide grand-slam home runs. But we currently find no equities that come close to meeting our tests."

He explains the valuation dynamic: "As this is written, little fear is visible in Wall Street. Instead, euphoria prevails - and why not? What could be more exhilarating than to participate in a bull market in which the rewards to owners of businesses become gloriously uncoupled from the plodding performances of the businesses themselves. Unfortunately, however, stocks can't outperform businesses indefinitely."

The mathematical reality is inescapable: "Indeed, because of the heavy transaction and investment management costs they bear, stockholders as a whole and over the long term must inevitably underperform the companies they own. If American business, in aggregate, earns about 12% on equity annually, investors must end up earning significantly less. Bull markets can obscure mathematical laws, but they cannot repeal them."

**Why It Matters:** This analysis captures Buffett's skepticism about valuations in 1986—a prescient warning just before the 1987 crash. More broadly, it reveals his conviction that long-term stock returns cannot exceed the underlying business returns they represent.

## **Point 8: Tax Reform Act of 1986 Materially Harms Insurance Business Economics While Benefiting Core Operating Companies**

**Key Message:** The Tax Reform Act of 1986 has divergent impacts on Berkshire: corporate rate decreases help See's, Buffalo News, and other operating businesses with strong franchises; however, insurance-specific tax changes—especially increased taxation of dividend and interest income, accelerated loss reserve deductions, and inclusion of unearned premiums in taxable income—reduce insurance earning power by estimated 10%.

**Details:** Buffett provides a sophisticated analysis of how tax changes affect different business types. For companies with strong franchises, tax cuts benefit shareholders: "In the case of unregulated businesses blessed with strong franchises, however, it's a different story: the corporation and its shareholders are then the major beneficiaries of tax cuts."

However, for price-competitive industries, tax changes flow through to customers: "In such industries, therefore, tax changes eventually affect prices more than profits."

The insurance industry is unusual: "The reason this industry is likely to be an exception to our general rule is that not all major insurers will be working with identical tax equations. Important differences will exist for several reasons: a new alternative minimum tax will materially affect some companies but not others; certain major insurers have huge loss carry-forwards that will largely shield their income from significant taxes for at least a few years."

The insurance-specific changes are devastating: "First, all corporations will be taxed on 20% of the dividends they receive from other domestic corporations, up from 15% under the old law...there is a change concerning the residual 80% that applies only to property/casualty companies: 15% of that residual will be taxed if the stocks paying the dividends were purchased after August 7, 1986."

Most problematically: "Another rule, to be phased in over six years, requires us to include 20% of our unearned premium reserve in taxable income...The net effect of the 'fresh start' is to give us a double deduction: we will get a tax deduction in 1987 and future years for a portion of our-incurred-but-unpaid insurance losses that have already been fully deducted as costs in 1986 and earlier years."

His overall assessment: "My best guess is that these changes alone will eventually reduce the earning power of our insurance operation by at least 10% from what we could previously have expected."

**Why It Matters:** This detailed tax analysis reveals how regulatory and tax changes can materially alter business economics independent of operational performance. It also demonstrates Buffett's sophistication in understanding how different tax structures affect different industries.

## **Point 9: Permanent Holdings Philosophy—Capital Cities, GEICO, and Washington Post Are Forever Investments**

**Key Message:** Berkshire intends to hold Capital Cities/ABC, GEICO, and Washington Post indefinitely, even if significantly overpriced. This "til-death-do-us-part" policy prioritizes managerial stability and long-term compounding over market timing.

**Details:** Buffett announces this fundamental shift in investment philosophy: "We should note that we expect to keep permanently our three primary holdings, Capital Cities/ABC, Inc., GEICO Corporation, and The Washington Post. Even if these securities were to appear significantly overpriced, we would not anticipate selling them, just as we would not sell See's or Buffalo Evening News if someone were to offer us a price far above what we believe those businesses are worth."

He frames this as counter to modern corporate practice: "This attitude may seem old-fashioned in a corporate world in which activity has become the order of the day. The modern manager refers to his 'portfolio' of businesses - meaning that all of them are candidates for 'restructuring' whenever such a move is dictated by Wall Street preferences, operating conditions or a new corporate 'concept.'"

The rationale is strategic: "Despite the enthusiasm for activity that has swept business and financial America, we will stick with our 'til-death-do-us-part policy. It's the only one with which Charlie and I are comfortable, it produces decent results, and it lets our managers and those of our investees run their businesses free of distractions."

**Why It Matters:** This permanent holdings philosophy contrasts sharply with modern portfolio management and demonstrates Buffett's belief that long-term compounding in exceptional businesses outweighs trading opportunities. The three holdings have indeed proven to be extraordinary long-term investments for Berkshire shareholders.

## **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**

Warren Buffett's 1986 shareholder letter captures Berkshire at a crucial juncture—a $7.2 billion company generating $23% annual returns on capital that faces the dual challenge of deploying enormous capital sums into an increasingly expensive stock market while managing an insurance business facing unfavorable tax changes.

**First, the recognition that business value growth exceeded book value growth—driven by unrecorded economic goodwill created by exceptional managers—reveals that Berkshire's most valuable asset is invisible to balance sheet accounting.** Managers like the Blumkins, Stan Lipsey, Chuck Huggins, and Ralph Schey have dramatically improved earnings with minimal incremental capital. This phenomenon explains Berkshire's persistent premium to book value and justifies Buffett's conviction in holding exceptional businesses indefinitely.

**Second, capital allocation difficulty in 1986 signals fundamental market constraints.** With no attractive equity opportunities and limited acquisition candidates, Buffett resorted to paying down debt and stockpiling cash. This candid acknowledgment—that even a skilled allocator cannot deploy capital productively when markets are overvalued—contrasts with the typical CEO's tendency to pursue acquisitions at any valuation.

**Third, Fechheimer Bros. demonstrates the power of Berkshire's disciplined acquisition criteria.** An unsolicited letter from a shareholder-CEO led to a $55 million acquisition of a business with proven economics, exceptional multi-generational management, and cultural alignment. This acquisition model—waiting for excellence to appear rather than pursuing mediocrity—has shaped Berkshire's portfolio.

**Fourth, the insurance industry analysis reveals commodity business dynamics with mathematical inevitability.** Premium growth must exceed loss growth by approximately 10% to maintain stable profitability. When conditions improve (as in 1986), capacity additions follow, ensuring future deterioration. Berkshire's advantage lies in financial strength and discipline to underwrite profitably while competitors price unprofitably.

**Fifth, GEICO's expanding cost moat and Lou Simpson's exceptional investment returns demonstrate how competitive advantages can strengthen over time.** GEICO's 23.5% expense ratio creates a 10+ point advantage over competitors, a gap that continues widening. Lou Simpson's 28.4% average annual returns (1980-1986) show that value investing disciplines produce superior results.

**Sixth, the Tax Reform Act of 1986 has profoundly negative implications for insurance economics.** While corporate rate decreases benefit businesses with strong franchises, insurance-specific changes—particularly the increased taxation of dividend and interest income and acceleration of loss reserve deductions—will reduce insurance earning power by an estimated 10%. This structural headwind would constrain Berkshire's growth for years.

**Finally, the permanent holdings philosophy signals a fundamental shift in investment orientation.** By committing to hold Capital Cities, GEICO, and Washington Post indefinitely—regardless of valuation—Buffett prioritizes managerial stability, long-term compounding, and freedom from market speculation over trading gains.

The 1986 letter essentially says: "We have built an exceptional portfolio of businesses with exceptional managers. We are unwilling to deploy vast capital at current market valuations. We expect insurance profitability to deteriorate as capacity is added and as tax changes reduce our earning power. But our permanent holdings in Capital Cities, GEICO, and Washington Post will compound at attractive rates indefinitely because we have aligned ourselves with first-rate people and first-rate businesses. Our challenge is patience." This perspective—combining realism about market valuations, humility about capital deployment challenges, and conviction about permanent holdings—would guide Berkshire through its subsequent evolution into a true megacap holding company.
