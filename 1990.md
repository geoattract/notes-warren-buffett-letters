# Berkshire Hathaway 1990 Shareholder Letter: 8 Key Insights

## **Insight 1: Intrinsic Value Diverging from Stock Price—The Double-Dip Exhaustion**

**Key Message:** Berkshire's stock price volatility (up 85% in 1989, down 23% in 1990) masks steady growth in intrinsic value, revealing that past returns included a one-time valuation catch-up bonus that is now exhausted.

**Details:** Buffett opens by noting 1990 was "lackluster" with only 7.3% net worth growth, acknowledging his prediction that "a reduction in Berkshire's net worth is almost certain in at least one of the next three years" came close to being realized. More importantly, he highlights the fundamental divergence between stock price movements and intrinsic value: in 1989, book value grew 44% while market price rose 85%, but in 1990, book and intrinsic value grew modestly while market price fell 23%. This reveals that much of past performance came from market repricing of undervalued assets—the "double-dip" of both underlying value creation plus valuation expansion. He emphasizes: "our catch-up rewards have been realized, which means we'll have to settle for a single-dip in the future." The company's four major holdings (Capital Cities, Coca-Cola, GEICO, Washington Post) were "at lofty levels" but now "far from enticing," meaning future returns depend entirely on underlying business value creation without the benefit of market revaluation.

**Why It Matters:** This distinguishes between sustainable returns (based on business value creation) and temporary windfalls (based on market repricing). Investors who assume Berkshire can replicate past returns will be disappointed—the one-time revaluation bonus is exhausted, and future returns depend on slower business value creation from a much larger capital base.

## **Insight 2: The Clown Analogy—Buffett's Role in Business Operations**

**Key Message:** Buffett's contribution to Berkshire's exceptional operating results is minimal; he merely "waves the magic wand" while subordinate managers perform the actual business transformation.

**Details:** Buffett illustrates his role through a charming anecdote about his granddaughter Emily at a magic show where a clown performs tricks and asks Emily to wave a "magic wand" over "the box of wonders." After green handkerchiefs transform to blue and loose ones become knotted, Emily exclaims: "Gee, I'm really good at this." Buffett concludes: "And that sums up my contribution to the performance of Berkshire's business magicians—the Blumkins, the Friedman family, Mike Goldberg, the Heldmans, Chuck Huggins, Stan Lipsey and Ralph Schey. They deserve your applause." This is important because it explicitly reframes Berkshire's success: the operating managers transformed mediocre businesses into exceptional ones, while Buffett's primary contribution is allocating capital and selecting managers—not operational involvement.

**Why It Matters:** This challenges the common assumption that CEOs drive business success through operational involvement. Buffett demonstrates that his real value lies in capital allocation and manager selection, not in running businesses. This also explains why Berkshire can acquire businesses with absentee ownership—the magic comes from the managers, not from headquarters.

## **Insight 3: Non-Insurance Operations Achieving 51% ROE With Zero Leverage**

**Key Message:** Berkshire's operating businesses generated 51% after-tax returns on average equity in 1990 without financial leverage, a performance that would rank 20th on Fortune 500 by return metrics.

**Details:** The eight operating businesses (Borsheim's, Buffalo News, Fechheimer, Kirby, Nebraska Furniture Mart, Scott Fetzer Manufacturing, See's, and World Book) achieved remarkable returns. More impressively, these returns were achieved with almost no leverage—most major facilities are owned rather than leased, and small debt is offset by cash holdings. If measured by return on assets (eliminating leverage effects), "our group would rank in Fortune's top ten." These aren't glamorous industries: furniture retailing, candy, vacuum cleaners, steel warehousing. Buffett notes: "Our extraordinary returns flow from outstanding operating managers, not fortuitous industry economics." Examples include: Borsheim's sales up 18% in a poor retail year; Nebraska Furniture Mart achieving $159 million in sales at a single location with 15% operating costs versus 40% for competitors; See's maintaining excellent margins despite weak retail environment.

**Why It Matters:** This demonstrates that exceptional returns don't require exceptional industries—they require exceptional management combined with strong economic franchises. The diversity of these businesses (jewelry, furniture, newspapers, candy, books, uniforms, vacuum cleaners, manufacturing) proves the principle is generalizable and not industry-dependent.

## **Insight 4: Media Business Vulnerability—A Permanent Shift in Economics**

**Key Message:** Media businesses face a structural deterioration in pricing power and intrinsic value, as advertising dollars become more dispersed across new channels and retailers increasingly bypass traditional advertising.

**Details:** Buffett admits being surprised by media industry vulnerability in 1990's early recession: "The business showed far more vulnerability to the early stages of a recession than has been the case in the past." He questions whether this erosion is "just part of an aberrational cycle" or represents "a permanent reduction in intrinsic business values." His conclusion: media will be "considerably less marvelous than I, the industry, or lenders thought would be the case only a few years ago." The causes: (1) advertising dollars growing slowly; (2) retailers using direct mail rather than media advertising, taking market share; (3) "the number of both print and electronic advertising channels has substantially increased," dispersing advertising dollars and reducing pricing power of ad vendors. He predicts Buffalo News earnings will "fall substantially" in 1991 despite Stan Lipsey's excellent management, due to rising newsprint prices and labor costs combined with declining revenues. The solution—maintaining 50% news hole despite margin pressure—is philosophically correct but economically challenging.

**Why It Matters:** This reveals Buffett's willingness to acknowledge that structural industry changes can permanently reduce business values, even for well-managed companies. The shift from concentrated advertising media to dispersed digital channels is a structural headwind that operational excellence cannot fully overcome.

## **Insight 5: Wells Fargo Investment—Buying Quality Banking at Panic Prices**

**Key Message:** Berkshire purchased nearly 10% of Wells Fargo during 1990's bank stock collapse, acquiring one of the industry's best-managed banks at prices reflecting panic-induced pessimism.

**Details:** Buffett increased Wells Fargo holdings to just under 10% (the maximum without Federal Reserve approval) for $290 million, purchasing a position equivalent to "100% of a $5 billion bank with identical financial characteristics" for roughly half the price such a bank would command. Wells Fargo's management pair—Carl Reichardt and Paul Hazen—reminds him of Capital Cities' Tom Murphy and Dan Burke: "each pair is stronger than the sum of its parts." The bank earns over 20% on equity and 1.25% on assets despite a chaotic market in bank stocks. He acknowledges three risks: (1) California earthquake damage to borrowers; (2) systemic financial panic; (3) real estate value collapse from overbuilding. Yet he notes Wells Fargo, even with 10% of its $48 billion loan portfolio hit by problems, would "roughly break even"—a scenario that "would not distress us." The 50% stock price decline during 1990 was welcomed because it allowed purchasing more shares at panic prices. He explains: "Investors who expect to be ongoing buyers of investments throughout their lifetimes should adopt a similar attitude toward market fluctuations."

**Why It Matters:** This illustrates how structural advantages (massive capital, patient shareholders, long time horizons) enable investors to profit from panic-induced pessimism. When others fear bank stocks, Berkshire buys the best banks at prices reflecting worst-case scenarios. The mathematical analysis shows that even severe loan losses wouldn't impair a well-managed bank—proving that pessimism can create false risk.

## **Insight 6: Insurance Float as Interest-Free Loan from Treasury**

**Key Message:** Berkshire's insurance operations developed $1.6 billion of float in 1990 at a cost of only 1.6%, demonstrating how float functions as an exceptionally cheap source of funds for investment.

**Details:** Buffett introduces a sophisticated framework for measuring insurance performance: underwriting loss divided by float developed, which measures the cost of funds generated by insurance operations. Over 24 years (1967-1990), Berkshire developed insurance float at an average cost significantly below government bond rates—in 19 of 24 years, the cost was below government bond yields. The 1990 calculation: $26.65 million underwriting loss / $1.6 billion average float = 1.63% cost of funds. This is remarkably cheap for permanent capital. Buffett notes two caveats: (1) the "fat lady hasn't sung"—true costs won't be known until all claims settle decades later; (2) shareholders bear a tax penalty since the company must fund the insurance operation with equity and faces double taxation on investment income. Despite these, he estimates the tax penalty adds only 1% to the cost, making Berkshire's effective float cost approximately 2.6%—still well below alternative sources of capital.

**Why It Matters:** This reveals how insurance float functions as a permanent, interest-free loan from the government (via deferred tax payments) and policyholders. This gives Berkshire an enormous competitive advantage in capital allocation—it can invest at 1.6% cost while competitors pay 5-10% for capital. GEICO's situation is even more extreme: it often operates at underwriting profit, meaning policyholders effectively pay Berkshire interest on the float.

## **Insight 7: Super-Catastrophe Insurance—Concentrated Risk for Superior Returns**

**Key Message:** Berkshire writes large catastrophe coverage that concentrates risk (rather than spreading it), enabling the company to accept volatility that competitors cannot tolerate in exchange for superior long-term returns.

**Details:** Berkshire became a large seller of "super-cat" reinsurance—policies protecting reinsurers against catastrophic losses from hurricanes, windstorms, and earthquakes. A typical example: writing a $10 million policy paying out only if a catastrophe causes losses exceeding $5 billion industry-wide, receiving $3 million premium. On $100 million annual premiums from super-cat business, Berkshire will report either ~$100 million profit or >$200 million loss in any given year, with combined ratios near 0% or 300%—never in the industry's normal 100-120% range. Buffett acknowledges most insurers cannot tolerate such volatility—they may face primary property insurance losses coinciding with super-cat reinsurance losses, and corporate boards believe shareholders dislike earnings volatility. Berkshire takes a different approach: (1) primary property insurance volume is small; (2) shareholders are properly informed and "can handle unusual volatility in profits so long as the swings carry with them the prospect of superior long-term results"; (3) Berkshire won't write business at prices below cost, so volume varies with pricing opportunities. This positioning makes Berkshire the largest U.S. super-cat writer, competitive advantage stemming from $6 billion insurance subsidiary net worth (second-highest in U.S.) and indifference to quarterly earnings volatility.

**Why It Matters:** This illustrates how structural advantages (capital strength, proper shareholder base, long-term orientation) enable differentiated strategies that competitors cannot match. By accepting volatility others avoid, Berkshire captures risk premiums unavailable to conventionally-managed insurers.

## **Insight 8: The "Look-Through" Earnings Framework—Understanding True Economic Performance**

**Key Message:** Standard accounting masks Berkshire's true earning power by excluding retained earnings of investees; a "look-through" calculation reveals the company's actual economic earnings are roughly $590 million, not the reported $371 million.

**Details:** Berkshire owns 17% of Capital Cities/ABC, which earned $83+ million in 1990, yet only $530,000 appears in Berkshire's GAAP earnings (dividends minus tax). The $82 million residual is retained but ultimately benefits Berkshire. Buffett's solution: "look-through" earnings calculation: (1) take $250 million, Berkshire's share of retained earnings by investees; (2) subtract $30 million for incremental taxes that would have been owed if distributed; (3) add remainder ($220 million) to reported operating earnings ($371 million) = $590 million look-through earnings. This framework acknowledges that when Coca-Cola retains earnings to repurchase shares, it increases Berkshire's ownership percentage in "the most valuable franchise in the world"—more efficiently than if earnings were distributed and Berkshire paid taxes on the dividend before repurchasing. Buffett emphasizes: "The way they are accounted for is of no importance, but their ownership and subsequent utilization is all-important. We care not whether the auditors hear a tree fall in the forest; we do care who owns the tree and what's next done with it."

**Why It Matters:** This reveals a critical gap between reported and economic earnings. Investors focusing solely on GAAP earnings of $371 million would miss the fact that true economic earning power is 60% higher. This framework also demonstrates how Berkshire benefits from having well-managed, owner-oriented CEOs running investee companies—they redeploy capital more efficiently than Berkshire could.

## Executive Summary

Berkshire Hathaway's 1990 letter addresses a critical inflection point: the one-time revaluation bonus that drove much of past performance is exhausted, and future returns must come from business value creation alone. With stock prices down 23% in 1990 after rising 85% in 1989, Buffett emphasizes the distinction between intrinsic value (steady growth) and stock price (volatile), setting realistic expectations for future returns.

The "clown anecdote" reframes Berkshire's success: operating managers transformed mediocre businesses into exceptional ones; Buffett's role is capital allocation and manager selection, not operational involvement. The non-insurance operations achieving 51% ROE without leverage demonstrate that exceptional returns flow from exceptional management combined with strong economic franchises, not from advantaged industries.

The media industry section delivers a sobering acknowledgment: structural changes (advertising dollars dispersed across new channels, retailers bypassing traditional advertising) permanently reduce intrinsic value even for well-managed companies like Buffalo News. This illustrates that operational excellence cannot overcome fundamental business model deterioration.

The Wells Fargo investment exemplifies Berkshire's approach to panic-induced pessimism: when others fear banks, Berkshire buys the best banks at prices reflecting worst-case scenarios. Mathematical analysis shows that even severe loan losses wouldn't impair a well-managed bank, proving that panic can create opportunities for patient capital.

The insurance float analysis reveals a sophisticated understanding of capital sources: Berkshire develops float at 1.6% cost (before tax penalty), creating an enormous competitive advantage for capital allocation. This interest-free loan from the government and policyholders enables investments at costs competitors cannot match.

The super-catastrophe insurance section demonstrates how structural advantages (capital strength, proper shareholder base, long-term orientation) enable differentiated strategies. By accepting volatility other insurers avoid, Berkshire captures risk premiums unavailable to conventionally-managed competitors and becomes the industry's largest super-cat writer.

Finally, the "look-through" earnings framework corrects a critical accounting deficiency: standard GAAP understates Berkshire's true economic earning power by excluding retained earnings of investees. The company's $590 million in look-through earnings (versus $371 million reported) reflects the true economic value creation from owning stakes in exceptional, owner-oriented businesses.

For investors, the key lessons are: (1) distinguish between sustainable business value creation and temporary valuation revaluation; (2) understand that operating managers, not headquarters, drive business success; (3) recognize that structural industry changes can permanently reduce business values; (4) treat market pessimism as an opportunity to buy quality at discount prices; (5) appreciate the value of low-cost sources of capital like insurance float; (6) accept that accepting volatility others avoid creates superior long-term returns; and (7) measure true economic earnings using "look-through" analysis rather than relying on GAAP reporting.
