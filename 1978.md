# Berkshire Hathaway 1978 Shareholder Letter: 8 Key Insights

---

## **Insight 1: Accounting Consolidation Can Obscure Economic Reality**

**Key Message:** Full consolidation of diverse businesses with different ownership percentages (100% owned vs. 58% owned) creates a misleading financial picture that management wouldn't use internally.

**Details:** The Diversified Retailing merger at year-end 1978 increased Berkshire's Blue Chip Stamps ownership to 58%, requiring full consolidation of Blue Chip's subsidiaries (See's Candies, Wesco Financial, etc.) alongside Berkshire's wholly-owned operations. This mixes fundamentally different businesses—textiles, insurance, candy, newspapers, trading stamps—with dramatically different economic characteristics. Buffett notes this "tends to obscure economic reality more than illuminate it" and represents "a form of presentation that we never prepare for internal use." The letter emphasizes that 1977 figures were retroactively restated as if the merger had occurred years earlier, making year-to-year comparisons confusing.

**Why It Matters:** This insight reveals how GAAP accounting can mislead investors and emphasizes the importance of segmented reporting to understand true business economics. It teaches investors to look beyond consolidated statements to understand underlying business quality.

## **Insight 2: Operating Returns on Equity Are More Sustainable Than Capital Gains**

**Key Message:** While capital gains significantly enhanced returns over three years, operating earnings and underlying business fundamentals determine long-term sustainability.

**Details:** Berkshire achieved a 19.4% return on beginning shareholders' equity from operations in 1978, nearly matching the 1972 record. However, Buffett warns that the impressive 25% annual equity growth over the past three years—driven by "good operating earnings and fairly substantial capital gains"—is not sustainable. The insurance cycle has turned downward in 1979, and underwriting margins will compress. Yet operating earnings measured in absolute dollars will likely increase because equity employed in the business has grown substantially. This reflects Buffett's distinction between temporary cyclical gains and durable operational performance.

**Why It Matters:** This teaches investors to distinguish between sustainable business earnings and temporary windfalls, and to maintain realistic expectations during favorable cycles that inevitably reverse.

## **Insight 3: The Textile Industry Exemplifies the Economics of Undifferentiated, Capital-Intensive Businesses**

**Key Message:** Producers of undifferentiated goods in capital-intensive industries inevitably earn inadequate returns unless supply is tight or shortage conditions exist.

**Details:** Despite $17 million in capital employed and improved 1978 earnings of $1.3 million, textiles continue to deliver poor returns. Buffett explains that "slow capital turnover, coupled with low profit margins on sales, inevitably produces inadequate returns on capital." When excess capacity exists—a likely permanent condition in textiles—prices reflect direct operating costs rather than capital employed. Even aggressive management pursuit of product differentiation, manufacturing efficiency, and market repositioning cannot overcome these structural constraints because "our competitors are just as diligently doing the same thing." Yet Berkshire continues operating textiles because they are major community employers, management is transparent about problems, and labor cooperates—not because of economic returns.

**Why It Matters:** This framework helps investors identify structurally poor businesses that will underperform regardless of management quality. It demonstrates Buffett's willingness to accept suboptimal capital allocation for stakeholder considerations, while being candid about the economic trade-off.

## **Insight 4: Insurance Underwriting Cycles Are Predictable; Margins Compress When Rates Lag Cost Inflation**

**Key Message:** Insurance profitability depends on whether rate increases keep pace with cost inflation; when rates lag inflation, underwriting losses become inevitable across the industry.

**Details:** The 1978 insurance industry results were excellent because 1976-1977 rate increases more than offset prior losses. However, Buffett predicts 1979 will deteriorate because "it is a virtual certainty that...the combined ratio for the industry will move up at least a few points, perhaps enough to throw the industry as a whole into an underwriting loss position." The math is straightforward: auto repair and medical costs rose over 9% in 1978-1979, while rates rose only 3%. This contrasts with yearend 1976 when rates had advanced 22% while costs were up 8%. Buffett acknowledges that "Margins will remain steady only if rates rise as fast as costs. This assuredly will not be the case in 1979."

**Why It Matters:** This demonstrates how to forecast insurance industry cycles based on simple economics—the relationship between premium rate increases and claim cost inflation. It reveals that even superior operators like Berkshire cannot outrun bad industry cycles.

## **Insight 5: Superior Insurance Operators Maintain Discipline to Reject Unprofitable Volume**

**Key Message:** Truly excellent insurance management reduces volume during soft markets rather than chasing business at inadequate prices.

**Details:** Phil Liesche's operation at National Indemnity achieved an $11 million underwriting profit on $90 million of earned premiums in 1978—an extraordinary result. However, Buffett notes that managing through the inevitable cycle downturn requires "unusual managerial discipline" to "reduce volume significantly, if needed, to achieve satisfactory underwriting." George Young's reinsurance department operates with this philosophy. Meanwhile, Buffett acknowledges that some expansion efforts have been "lackluster" or "expensive failures," illustrating that building insurance businesses is harder than acquiring established ones. National Indemnity, purchased in 1967, "still remains, by a large margin, the best portion of our insurance business."

**Why It Matters:** This insight separates operators who think like owners from those who chase growth metrics. It shows that sustainable insurance returns require countercyclical discipline and demonstrate why Phil Liesche's operation outperformed for decades.

## **Insight 6: Equity Markets Frequently Price Outstanding Businesses at Dramatic Discounts to Whole-Company Valuations**

**Key Message:** Public stock markets price small fractions of excellent companies far below what those same businesses command in negotiated acquisitions.

**Details:** Berkshire's insurance company equity positions grew from $39.3 million at cost (end of 1975) to $129.1 million at cost and $216.5 million at market value (end of 1978), generating $112 million in unrealized and realized gains over three years. This occurred while "the Dow-Jones Industrial Average declined from 852 to 805." The prime example is SAFECO Corporation: Berkshire owns 953,750 shares, with 1978 earnings of $6.1 million attributable to their stake, yet purchased "at substantially under book value...less than 100 cents on the dollar for the best company in the business, when far more than 100 cents on the dollar is being paid for mediocre companies in corporate transactions."

**Why It Matters:** This reveals the persistent arbitrage opportunity between negotiated whole-company valuations and public market prices for high-quality businesses. It explains Berkshire's strategy of buying pieces of excellent businesses rather than acquiring entire mediocre ones at premium prices.

## **Insight 7: Retained Earnings by Well-Managed Companies Create Hidden Value Not Reported in Operating Earnings**

**Key Message:** Retained earnings of excellent companies—reinvested at attractive returns—eventually create value worth more than 100 cents per dollar, even if not initially reflected in reported earnings.

**Details:** SAFECO retained approximately 82% of 1978 earnings ($6.1 million earned, only $1.1 million distributed), yet Buffett argues these retained earnings "may well eventually have a value to shareholders greater than 100 cents on the dollar" because management deploys capital at excellent returns. This "does not enter into our reported operating earnings, but we feel it well may have equal long-term significance to our shareholders." Buffett notes that "the aggregate level of such retained earnings attributable to our equity interests in fine companies is becoming quite substantial." This distinction matters: earnings retention makes sense only when capital can be deployed at attractive rates and management has a proven track record of profitable reinvestment.

**Why It Matters:** This framework helps investors evaluate dividend policy and capital allocation at companies they own partially. It explains why Buffett doesn't demand dividends from excellent businesses reinvesting at high returns.

## **Insight 8: Exceptional Managers Who Think Like Owners Create Durable Competitive Advantages**

**Key Message:** Long-tenured managers with proprietary attitudes—bringing passion and owner-thinking to their roles—consistently deliver superior results and deserve compensation beyond traditional benchmarks.

**Details:** Gene Abegg (Illinois National Bank, age 81), Ben Rosner (Associated Retail Stores, age 75), and Louie Vincenti (Wesco Financial, age 73) continue to manage businesses they helped build, "instinctively and unerringly think like owners." Illinois National Bank generated 2.1% earnings on average assets—three times the major bank average—while maintaining lower asset risk. Associated Retail Stores faced adverse demographic and retail trends but delivered "returns on capital often in the 20% after-tax area" through Ben's "merchandising, real estate and cost-containment skills." Buffett acknowledges this group "must appear to an outsider to be an overreaction...to an OEO bulletin on age discrimination" but calls these relationships "exceptionally rewarding, both financially and personally."

**Why It Matters:** This insight reveals that investor-owned businesses with long-tenured, founder-aligned managers outperform professional-manager-led competitors. It explains Berkshire's willingness to maintain these relationships despite unconventional age profiles, and demonstrates that managerial alignment creates durable competitive advantages.

# Executive Summary

Warren Buffett's 1978 letter presents Berkshire as a maturing enterprise managing three distinct economic cycles simultaneously: the structurally challenged textile business (requiring stakeholder patience), the cyclical insurance underwriting business (enjoying favorable 1978 conditions but facing compression in 1979), and the equity investment portfolio (achieving extraordinary returns through bargain purchases of excellent businesses). The unifying theme is **economic realism**—understanding which businesses create sustainable value and which depend on temporary cycles or structural advantages.

The Diversified Retailing merger, while consolidating disparate businesses under one holding company, reveals Buffett's commitment to transparency about true economics. His detailed segment analysis demonstrates that consolidated GAAP statements obscure reality; investors must disaggregate businesses to understand management quality and competitive positioning. This lesson applies broadly: never accept reported earnings without examining underlying business unit economics and ownership percentages.

The letter's most important insight concerns the persistent mispricing of excellent businesses in public markets. Over three years of declining stock prices (Dow down from 852 to 805), Berkshire purchased $112 million in unrealized gains by buying pieces of superior businesses—SAFECO, The Washington Post Company, Capital Cities Communications—at prices below book value. Buffett's explicit argument: corporations overpay for entire businesses in negotiated transactions, while public markets simultaneously underprice small stakes in those same excellent companies. This arbitrage opportunity emerges repeatedly throughout investment cycles.

Insurance operations exemplify Buffett's framework for sustainable business selection. National Indemnity's success derives partly from favorable 1978 cycles but primarily from Phil Liesche's discipline—maintaining underwriting margins through willingness to reduce volume when rates inadequately compensate for risk. This contrasts sharply with competitors who chase growth metrics. Similarly, equity investments in well-managed operators like SAFECO and The Washington Post Company appeal because management demonstrates superior capital deployment, justifying retention of earnings rather than distribution. Buffett's willingness to accept passive minority stakes in better-managed companies, rather than controlling mediocre ones, represents an unconventional yet economically superior strategy.

Finally, the letter celebrates exceptional manager-owners like Gene Abegg, Ben Rosner, and Louie Vincenti, who deliver 20%+ after-tax returns in mature businesses through proprietarily-focused management. This demonstrates that competitive advantages flow from alignment between ownership and management incentives, not from scale or industry position. By 1978, Berkshire had evolved from a failing textile company into a sophisticated holding company that acquires excellent businesses (insurance, banking, retail), purchases minorities in great businesses (insurance investments), and provides capital platforms for owner-managers to deploy. The result: sustainable compounding that exceeds market returns while maintaining lower risk through diversified, quality businesses managed by people who think like owners.
