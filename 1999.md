# Berkshire Hathaway 1999 Shareholder Letter: 9 Essential Insights

## **Point 1: Honest Accountability – The Worst Year of Buffett's Tenure**

**Key Message:** Buffett takes full personal responsibility for Berkshire's worst absolute and relative performance, grading himself a "D" for capital allocation.

**Details:** With per-share book value growing only 0.5% in 1999, Buffett opens with remarkable candor: "My performance reminds me of the quarterback whose report card showed four Fs and a D but who nonetheless had an understanding coach." The primary culprit: his equity portfolio underperformed the S&P 500. Several major investees—American Express, Coca-Cola, Gillette, Wells Fargo—had disappointing operating results. Buffett emphasizes the crucial distinction: "Relative results are what concern us: Over time, bad relative numbers will produce unsatisfactory absolute results." Despite owning wonderful businesses, their stumbles damaged 1999 performance, and "it's no sure thing that they will quickly regain their stride."

**Why It Matters:** This contrasts sharply with most CEO communications, where poor performance is blamed on market conditions or external factors. Buffett's willingness to accept accountability—and publicly grade himself—demonstrates a leadership philosophy centered on truth-telling rather than spin. For investors, this honesty about mistakes is more valuable than any spin.

## **Point 2: Tempering Expectations – Why "Modest" Outperformance of the S&P is the Realistic Target**

**Key Message:** Despite confidence Berkshire will modestly exceed S&P returns, Buffett warns that the era of "truly large superiorities" over the index has permanently ended.

**Details:** Buffett reaffirms conviction that "the gain in Berkshire's intrinsic value over the next decade will modestly exceed the gain from owning the S&P," backing this with over 99% of his net worth invested in Berkshire. However, he emphasizes the word "modestly," noting: "For Berkshire, truly large superiorities over that index are a thing of the past." The reason is mathematical: in Berkshire's early decades, the company could buy businesses and stocks at far more attractive prices, and it had a smaller capital base permitting a much wider range of investment opportunities. Now, with $57.8 billion in book value, those advantages have disappeared. Additionally, Buffett expects the S&P itself will deliver dramatically lower returns over the next decade or two than it has since 1982 (an enclosed Fortune article explains his thinking).

**Why It Matters:** This demonstrates the discipline to reset expectations downward based on changed circumstances rather than past performance. Most investors and managers extrapolate historical returns indefinitely; Buffett's willingness to acknowledge structural constraints on future performance reflects mathematical realism about scale and market valuations.

## **Point 3: The R.C. Willey Story – When a Manager Puts Principles Above Profit**

**Key Message:** Exceptional managers often possess integrity and principles that transcend financial considerations, and Berkshire's ownership structure attracts and retains such people.

**Details:** Buffett recounts the extraordinary story of R.C. Willey's Bill Child, whose company has operated without Sunday hours for decades due to his Mormon faith. Despite Buffett's skepticism, Child insisted on opening a Boise store while personally funding construction (~$9 million). Child's extraordinary offer: if the store succeeded, Berkshire would pay his cost; if it failed, Berkshire paid nothing and Child absorbed the loss. The store "immediately became a huge success," and Child transferred the property to Berkshire, refusing even interest on his two years of capital deployment. Buffett concludes: "If a manager has behaved similarly at some other public corporation, I haven't heard about it. You can understand why the opportunity to partner with people like Bill Child causes me to tap dance to work every morning."

**Why It Matters:** This illustrates Berkshire's hidden advantage: its ownership culture attracts exceptionally principled managers who make decisions based on ethics and long-term value rather than short-term personal gain. This cannot be replicated through compensation schemes alone—it requires a corporate culture that genuinely empowers and trusts managers.

## **Point 4: GEICO's Relentless Growth – From 652 to 2,631 Counselors in Four Years**

**Key Message:** GEICO's explosive expansion demonstrates how patient capital and performance-aligned incentives create sustainable competitive advantage in a capital-intensive business model.

**Details:** GEICO's new auto policies grew from 443,539 in 1995 to 1,648,095 in 1999—a 272% increase. Telephone counselors expanded from 652 to 2,631 (+304%). Marketing spend surged from $33 million to $242 million. Yet profitability remained strong due to structural advantages: GEICO's cost of new business is "well below that of the industry," and operating costs for renewal business are "the lowest among broad-based national auto insurers." Buffett notes these advantages are "sustainable. Others may copy our model, but they will be unable to replicate our economics." Market share rose from 2.7% to 4.1% in three years. Profit-sharing payments of 28.4% of salary ($113.3 million) reward associates for the two metrics that matter: policyholder growth and seasoned business earnings.

**Why It Matters:** GEICO exemplifies how Berkshire's structure enables long-term thinking that most public companies cannot stomach. The willingness to spend $242 million on growth initiatives that produce initial losses—and to make additional commitments reaching $1 billion annually—demonstrates how patient, aligned capital creates durable advantages in capital-intensive businesses.

## **Point 5: Float Economics – The Real Engine of Berkshire's Value Creation**

**Key Message:** Insurance float, when its cost is below market rates for capital, becomes the most valuable asset a company can possess—transforming a liability into economic treasure.

**Details:** Berkshire's total float grew from $20 million in 1967 to $25.298 billion in 1999. Critically, the cost of this float has been exceptional: cumulative underwriting profit through 1998, with only a $1.4 billion loss in 1999 (5.8% cost of float). Buffett explains the mechanics: premiums are collected before losses are paid, permitting investment during the interval. If underwriting is profitable, the company is "being paid for holding other people's money." Berkshire's insurance operations have generated this "no-cost" or "negative-cost" float for decades, yet this float is recorded as a liability on the balance sheet—a beautiful accounting fiction that masks genuine economic value. Ajit Jain's super-cat reinsurance business alone holds $6.3 billion of float and has earned consistent underwriting profits while producing exceptional volatility.

**Why It Matters:** Float is the secret economic engine that most investors misunderstand. Most insurance companies treat float as a cost to be minimized; Berkshire weaponizes it through disciplined underwriting, creating a permanent, interest-free funding source for investments. This is why insurance is central to Berkshire's competitive moat.

## **Point 6: The Jordan's Furniture Acquisition – Integrity in Capital Allocation**

**Key Message:** Berkshire's acquisition strategy prioritizes managers of exceptional character whose values align with long-term shareholder value, even when it requires unconventional capital structures.

**Details:** Berkshire acquired Jordan's Furniture from the Tatelman brothers for cash in November 1999, following the acquisition of Nebraska Furniture Mart (1983), R.C. Willey (1995), and Star Furniture (1997). The Tatelmans' extraordinary gesture: paying $9 million from their own pockets to distribute $0.50 per hour worked to every employee—money that had nothing to do with the sale price. Buffett praises their "class": "Barry and Eliot were thrilled to write the checks." Jordan's is now the largest furniture retailer in Massachusetts and New Hampshire, achieving the highest sales per square foot of any major furniture retailer in America. Notably, all acquisitions were made for cash, "issuing no Berkshire shares," which aligns with Buffett's conviction that "Deals of that kind aren't always possible, but that is the method of acquisition that Charlie and I vastly prefer."

**Why It Matters:** This demonstrates Buffett's strategic preference: cash acquisitions preserve optionality, avoid share dilution, and attract seller-entrepreneurs who want certainty rather than stock exposure. The Tatelmans' character—demonstrated by their voluntary $9 million employee distribution—reveals the type of principals Berkshire attracts: long-term thinkers prioritizing people over personal gain.

## **Point 7: The Pooling vs. Purchase Accounting Debate – Rejecting Accounting Fiction**

**Key Message:** Pooling-of-interests accounting masks reality by avoiding goodwill charges, while Buffett advocates for impairment-based accounting that reflects economic truth.

**Details:** The FASB proposed eliminating pooling-of-interests accounting, which allows acquisitions to avoid creating goodwill and thus avoid subsequent charges to earnings. CEOs oppose this because it makes reported earnings look worse. Buffett argues that pooling accounting is fundamentally dishonest: when two companies merge, there indisputably is an acquirer and an acquiree. Yet pooling treats them as equals. He proposes a reality-based alternative: record the purchase price at fair value, create a goodwill asset representing economic goodwill, and leave it on the books unless impaired. This avoids the nonsensical charges for diminishing goodwill while accurately reflecting economic reality. Buffett notes: "economic goodwill does not, in many cases, diminish. Indeed, in a great many instances -- perhaps most -- it actually grows in value over time," citing See's, which has grown economic goodwill substantially for 78 years.

**Why It Matters:** This critique exposes how accounting conventions distort capital allocation decisions. Managers make acquisitions based on reported earnings impact rather than economic value, leading to suboptimal decisions. Buffett's proposed impairment-based approach would align accounting with economic reality and rationalize M&A behavior.

## **Point 8: The Repurchase Paradox – Why Most Share Buybacks Destroy Value**

**Key Message:** Companies today repurchase shares primarily to support stock prices and manage option dilution, rather than because shares trade below intrinsic value—a practice that benefits selling shareholders at the expense of continuing shareholders.

**Details:** Buffett explains when buybacks make sense: only when shares trade "well below its intrinsic value, conservatively-calculated," and the company has excess cash beyond near-term business needs. Today's reality is perverted: "Now, repurchases are all the rage, but are all too often made for an unstated and, in our view, ignoble reason: to pump or support the stock price." He condemns the practice of repurchasing shares to offset option dilution: "This 'buy high, sell low' strategy is one many unfortunate investors have employed -- but never intentionally! Managements, however, seem to follow this perverse activity very cheerfully." Buffett notes that too often, shares are repurchased at or above intrinsic value. He commits: "We will not repurchase shares unless we believe Berkshire stock is selling well below intrinsic value, conservatively calculated."

**Why It Matters:** This exposes a systemic problem in corporate America: buybacks have become a tool for earnings manipulation and option offset rather than genuine value creation. Continuing shareholders are penalized when shares are repurchased above intrinsic value, yet most corporations engage in this practice routinely.

## **Point 9: The Technology Blind Spot – Staying Within the Circle of Competence**

**Key Message:** Berkshire's refusal to invest in technology companies reflects disciplined commitment to competitive advantage assessment, not inability to understand innovation.

**Details:** Buffett acknowledges that "our society will be transformed by their [tech] products and services," yet Berkshire owns no tech stocks. The reason: "Our problem -- which we can't solve by studying up -- is that we have no insights into which participants in the tech field possess a truly durable competitive advantage." He emphasizes this is not distressing: "After all, there are a great many business areas in which Charlie and I have no special capital-allocation expertise. For instance, we bring nothing to the table when it comes to evaluating patents, manufacturing processes or geological prospects. So we simply don't get into judgments in those fields." His strength lies in "recognizing when we are operating well within our circle of competence and when we are approaching the perimeter." Rather than envying those claiming predictive skill in fast-changing industries, Berkshire simply avoids the category: "If we stray, we will have done so inadvertently, not because we got restless and substituted hope for rationality."

**Why It Matters:** This demonstrates intellectual discipline rare in investing: the willingness to say "I don't know" and stay uninvested rather than pretending to expertise. As the tech bubble reaches its peak in late 1999, this contrarian posture positions Berkshire to avoid the massive capital destruction ahead.

## **Executive Summary**

Warren Buffett's 1999 letter is a masterclass in honest introspection. After the worst performance of his tenure—book value up only 0.5%, stock down despite strong underlying business performance—Buffett accepts full accountability, grading his capital allocation a "D." This candor is refreshing in an era of CEO spin, and it reflects a fundamental conviction: long-term success requires truth-telling, not narrative management.

The letter's central theme is the tension between principles and performance. Buffett celebrates managers like Bill Child and the Tatelman brothers, whose decisions are guided by integrity and long-term value creation rather than short-term financial optimization. These individuals don't need Berkshire's money—they work because they believe in their businesses and the people they employ. This culture of principle attracts the exceptional talent that Berkshire depends upon, creating a self-reinforcing virtuous cycle.

Offsetting this celebration of character, Buffett launches sharp critiques of corporate America's systemic dishonesty: pooling-of-interests accounting that masks economic reality, share repurchases designed to manipulate earnings rather than create value, and stock-option accounting that hides massive costs from investors. He warns that equity valuations in late 1999 are "wildly optimistic," with investors assuming returns far exceeding mathematical reality given 3% real GDP growth and 5% profit growth. This prescient warning, delivered as the tech bubble reaches its apex, positions Berkshire to avoid catastrophic capital destruction.

Finally, Buffett demonstrates the discipline to acknowledge Berkshire's structural limitations. With $57.8 billion in book value, the era of "truly large superiorities" over the S&P has ended. Market valuations are unattractive, and he has no special insights into technology companies. Rather than chasing growth through forced investments, Buffett commits to staying within his circle of competence and waiting for opportunities to deploy capital at attractive valuations. This discipline—combined with his honest accountability for poor performance and attraction of principled managers—positions Berkshire to compound value over the long term, even if future returns will be more modest than the past. In an era of corporate dishonesty and inflated expectations, Berkshire's commitment to truth, principles, and mathematical realism is its greatest competitive advantage.
